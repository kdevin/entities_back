  "description": "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has the lowest confidence rating of the top six Premier League club's managers, a new poll has shown.",
  "content": "The survey of over 140,000 football fans from 38 countries across five continents, undertaken by the app Forza Football, explores fans' sentiment on key footballing issues, such as whether they have confidence in their club's manager, squad and chairman.Data shows only 36 per cent of Arsenal fans think Wenger is still the right man for the job following the 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth in January, the lowest confidence rating any of the top six managers have recorded at any point this season.That rating is likely to fluctuate following the confirmation of Henrikh Mkhitaryan's transfer to Arsenal, which saw Alexis Sanchez move to Old Trafford in a swap deal.Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho, who has come under criticism for Man United's playing style this season, still has the backing of 64 per cent of the club's supporters - although that figure is down from a peak of 84 per cent at the beginning of October.Jurgen Klopp currently tops the approval charts with 89 per cent of Liverpool supporters having confidence in the German despite the Â£146m sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona this month.Klopp ranks ahead of Pep Guardiola, whose Manchester City side currently lead the Premier League standings by 12 points.Guardiola only had 73 per cent of City fans on his side at the beginning of the season but the club's performances over the last six months has seen that rise to 85 per cent in the latest poll.Tottenham supporters have fluctuated the least throughout the season with Mauricio Pochettino's highest (88 per cent) and lowest (83 per cent) average monthly approval rating only separated by five percentage points.",
