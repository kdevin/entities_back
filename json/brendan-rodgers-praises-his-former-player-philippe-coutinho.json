  "description": "Brendan Rodgers has hailed the talents of Philippe Coutinho, who recently joined La Liga leaders Barcelona for £146m.",
  "content": "The Brazilian was 20 years old when he moved to Liverpool in January 2013, and spent his first two-and-a-half years working under the then-Anfield boss Rodgers.The current Celtic manager says he is not surprised by the huge fee Barca have paid for his services.Rodgers said: \"Neymar's move [Barcelona to PSG for £198m] has changed the dynamics and a lot of the South American players have dreams of playing for Real Madrid or Barcelona.\"He certainly has the quality to play for Barcelona.\"Looking back on when Coutinho first arrived in England, Rodgers added: \"He only had one Brazil cap when he moved to the country.\"I remember going to Wembley to attend the work permit hearing and trying to convince the panel to allow him in the country to play.\"Barcelona's a good move for him, and for Liverpool it is a huge return on what they paid.\"Meanwhile, Celtic open their Scottish Cup defence with a home game against Championship club Brechin City, who are bottom of the table following promotion last season.However, Rodgers says the runaway Scottish Premiership leaders will not be taking Saturday's opponents lightly.He said: \"Always tricky games. It's a home game and it's nice to have a home game. But I'm certain Brechin will provide a tough game.\"When I watched them, they are certainly playing for the manager.\"They have made a step up to the Championship and it can be difficult. A lot of the teams there are full time.\"But we need to be professional and get through the tie. And they deserve our full respect.\""
