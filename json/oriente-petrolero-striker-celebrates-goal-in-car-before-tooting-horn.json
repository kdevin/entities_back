  "description": "Oriente Petrolero striker Maximiliano Freitas chose to celebrate scoring a goal against Universitario by sitting in a sponsor's car behind the goal.",
  "content": "Freitas chose a novel way to celebrate his goal in his Bolivian club's Copa Libertadores win over Peru's Universitario on Monday night, jumping over the advertising boards before sprinting to a parked car.The striker sat in a sponsor's car behind the goal after netting with 10 minutes to go, before being joined by his team-mates and tooting the horn.He had only been on the pitch for a minute as a second-half substitute, but the referee was less than amused, handing the burly Freitas, nicknamed 'Tanque', a yellow card.Antoine Griezmann performed a similar car celebration while playing for Real Sociedad in October 2010, sitting in the driver's seat while his team-mates joined him to celebrate during a 3-0 win over Deportivo.Watch the bizarre celebration in the video above!"
