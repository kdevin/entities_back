  "description": "West Ham have rejected an offer from Rennes for striker Diafra Sakho, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "Sakho passed an unauthorised medical with the Ligue 1 club on the penultimate day of the last transfer window, although a proposed £9m move to France failed to materialise for the 28-year-old.Sky Sports News understands Sakho wants to leave the Hammers because he feels undervalued compared to the club's other strikers.The forward currently earns £30,000 a week at the London Stadium, while the other strikers in squad earn between £80,000 and £110,000 a week.Sky Sports News understands Crystal Palace agreed a fee, thought to be between £10m and £12m, for the striker earlier this month, although one source close to the deal has suggested Roy Hodgon's side have pulled out of the move.Swansea, West Brom, Brighton, Bordeaux, Nice and Marseille are also reportedly interested in the striker, who joined West Ham from Metz in 2014.Sakho has played 17 games for the Hammers this season, although he is yet to start a match in the Premier League."
