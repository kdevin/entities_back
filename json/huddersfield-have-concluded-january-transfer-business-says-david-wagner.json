Even if I have my eye on the market I'm very happy with the players we have,\" Wagner said in his press conference on Thursday.\n\"Of course something could change in the next two or three weeks but if everything goes to plan we've done what we wanted to do and I'm very happy with what we have together, and this is why we don't have to discuss further names in this window.\"\nPritchard has arrived from Norwich on a three-and-a-half year deal for a fee understood to be in the region of £12m.\n\"He is a player who really likes to play football in the tight spaces who is confident and brave enough to ask for the ball,\" said Wagner.\n\"He can create and score goals so I think he is the type of player we haven't had in this group so far in this number 10 spot. He has shown in training and in the minutes he played against West Ham that with the ball he has a lot of things to give us which can add to our group.\"\nThe German manager also refuted talk of a move for Borussia Dortmund defender Neven Subotic and a potential reunion with a player he formerly worked with.\nWagner was asked about speculation surrounding Subotic and also a potential move for Chievo's Belgian midfielder Samuel Bastien.\n\"I know Neven [Subotic] very well, a great guy, a very good character and a very good player as well but as everybody knows in the centre back position we have no pressure or no problems.\"\nWagner then went on to ask for more details on Bastien - a player he wasn't aware of - before simply replying: \"Okay, no.\"\n",
