  "description": "Bournemouth deepened Arsenal's misery with a 2-1 comeback victory on an afternoon when Alexis Sanchez's January exit appeared ever closer.",
  "content": "Hector Bellerin's scruffy finish to a fine move (52) looked like sealing a morale-boosting win for a side without the omitted contract rebel, but the hosts completed a second-half turnaround through Callum Wilson (70) and Jordon Ibe (74) to boost their survival hopes and further dent Arsenal's top-four ambitions.Arsene Wenger had admitted before the game that Sanchez's future would be resolved imminently, but while an end appears in sight to the saga that has long cast a shadow, the on-field troubles continue for a Gunners team embarrassed in the FA Cup a week ago and now winless in five games in all competitions.More to follow."
