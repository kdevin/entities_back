  "description": "Celtic brushed aside Brechin, while Aberdeen made light work of St Mirren on a busy Saturday of Scottish Cup fourth-round action.",
  "content": "James Forrest sparked a goal rush as Brendan Rodgers' holders routed Brechin 5-0 at Parkhead to advance, the Scotland winger converting Scott Sinclair's cut-back in just the second minute.Sinclair doubled the lead in the 11th minute and second-half headers from Olivier Ntcham and Dedryck Boyata took the game away from the Championship side, before Odsonne Edouard fired a late fifth goal.Aberdeen, runners-up at Hampden last year, made light work of St Mirren as Ryan Christie scored twice in a 4-1 victory.An early Adam Rooney penalty nudged the Dons ahead before Christie netted either side of Gavin Reilly's strike for the visitors. Gary Mackay-Steven added a fourth after the interval for Aberdeen as their top-flight class told against the Buddies.Motherwell earned derby bragging rights as they beat Hamilton 2-0 at Fir Park thanks to a fourth-minute Scott McMann own goal and Craig Tanner's 35th-minute penalty.Inverness striker George Oakley rescued his side with a late goal that secured a 2-2 draw with Dundee at Dens Park.The hosts looked to have booked their place in Sunday's draw for the last 16 when goals from Sofien Moussa and Mark O'Hara cancelled out Aaron Doran's early opener.But Oakley's strike with just two minutes left means the teams will have to do it all over again in the Highlands on January 31.Lee Erwin's 88th-minute penalty gave Kilmarnock a 1-0 win over Ross County, with the spot-kick awarded after Tim Chow was sent off for bringing down Rory McKenzie.Highland League side Brora Rangers reached the fifth round for the first time, with Colin Williamson's header in the 12th minute delivering a 1-0 win at League One side East Fife.Connor Sammon scored both goals for Partick Thistle in a 2-1 victory at Queen of the South, whose reply came from Ross Fergusson.Two-time cup winners Dundee United marched on with a 2-0 win at Alloa, thanks to goals from Mark Durnan and Emil Lyng.Declan McDaid netted twice in Ayr's 4-1 victory against Arbroath, and Jai Quitongo snatched an 85th-minute winner as Morton came out on top 2-1 at Dunfermline.The games between Albion-St Johnstone, Livingston-Falkirk and Peterhead-Dumbarton were all postponed."
