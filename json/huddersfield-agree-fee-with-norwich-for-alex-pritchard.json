  "content": "The Terriers will pay an initial fee of £10m for the former Tottenham midfielder. The deal could eventually be worth £12m for Norwich.Pritchard, a former England U21 international, is expected to undergo a Huddersfield medical on Thursday.The 24-year-old has scored eight goals in 43 games for Norwich since an £8m move from Tottenham in 2016.Huddersfield boss David Wagner previously confirmed his interest in Pritchard but insisted he would not be held to ransom.\"Pritchard is not my player, he is a Norwich player,\" he said. \"I like him, but I have my doubts if he will play for us because I know how expensive British players are in this window.\"If we are able to get some British players in they have to be reasonable prices. At the end it is all about quality.\"If it's one new signing with the quality to help us, good. If it's two, I'll take two. We need to be focused on the quality.\""
