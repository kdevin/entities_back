  "description": "Robert Snodgrass sealed all three points for Aston Villa against Sheffield Utd with a sublime winner at Bramall Lane.",
  "content": "After a tightly-contested affair in the Steel City, it looked as though the two sides would be forced to settle for a point apiece, as they had done at Villa Park earlier in the season.\nBut in the 90th minute, Snodgrass produced a moment of magic to earn his side a late, late victory.\nThe Scot rampaged down the right flank, before forcing his way into the area, cutting the ball onto his favoured left and striking an unstoppable curling effort past Simon Moore in the Blades' goal.\nBoth John Fleck and Leon Clarke tried to force a stoppage-time equaliser, but it wasn't to be as Snodgrass' stunner ultimately settled the tie.\nClick on the video above to see Snodgrass' winner at Bramall Lane.\n",
