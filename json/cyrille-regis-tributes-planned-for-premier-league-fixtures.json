He was my agent ever since I was 16, when I signed for Chelsea. He was there every step of the way with me.\"When I was a young player, he gave me good advice about all the things he had been through, and he has passed that on to me and all the other players he looked after.\"He was still in contact with me and I met him before Christmas. He came up and watched the second last game before the winter break and we met at the hotel and had a general chat.\"It was devastating news and so sad to hear, especially when you have known someone so long and are close to them and, in particular, it's a really sad time for his family.\""
