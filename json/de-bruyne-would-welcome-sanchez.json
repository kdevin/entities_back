Obviously we will see what happens in this transfer period,\" De Bruyne said.\"If a good player comes to us that is better, if he doesn't come we do it with the team we have. We are on a good period already - the whole season. Everybody is doing a good job.\"If he comes he will add something to the team.\"City are thought to be close to agreeing a new contract with De Bruyne himself but he is relaxed over the situation and insists there is no rush.\"We are still in negotiations. I am waiting for an offer from the club but my agent has been on holiday for three weeks. There is nothing really new for the moment,\" the 26-year-old said.\"I'm not in a hurry. I still have three-and-a-half years on the contract.\""
