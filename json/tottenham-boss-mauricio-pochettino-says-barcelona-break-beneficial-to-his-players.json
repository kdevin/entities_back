Being all together for the new players, for the staff, for everyone, it's important.\"It's true that we have amazing facilities [back in Enfield], but always to change the routine is important. It's a moment and a break that helps for the rest of the season.\"The Argentine boss also emphasised the importance of working on team bonding during their time in Barcelona, as well as training.\"Both things are so important, to stay all together and then training too,\" added Pochettino.\"That is the objective and that is how we look at that situation. I think it will be important for the team.\"Next up for Spurs is a trip to the south coast to face Southampton on Nissan Super Sunday.
