People can say what they want but we'll continue to be positive and push forward. You never know. It happened in 2012 to us so why not?\"Man United face a trip to Burnley on Saturday and will hope to close the gap further to nine points before Man City host Newcastle United at the Etihad Stadium in the day's late kick-off."
