  "content": "Pep Guardiola's City required a late winner to take a 2-1 advantage to Ashton Gate on Tuesday night, while there's nothing between Arsenal and Chelsea ahead of their Emirates showdown, as they drew 0-0 at Stamford Bridge.Here's what Charlie is predicting for the second legs...You could see the frustration on the Bristol City's players' faces when Manchester City got their late winner in the first leg because they gave everything and Guardiola's side were average.Now, after doing so well packing men behind the ball and playing on the counter-attack, they've got to open up and expose themselves.They might think they'll get more of the ball at home but they won't. If they want to try the Liverpool tactics and really press them then I think Manchester City will pick them off.I think Pep will play a strong side as he can make a couple of changes in the FA Cup against Cardiff at the weekend, so I can only see a comfortable Manchester City win, with Leroy Sane and Kevin De Bruyne getting on the scoresheet.Charlie predicts: 4-1 and De Bruyne to score first - 55/1 with Sky BetLet's be fair to Arsenal. With a so-called weakened team at the weekend, they played really well against Crystal Palace, especially in that opening 25-minute spell, with Mesut Ozil controlling the game.Also with key players missing, Chelsea were brilliant at the start and then end of their win over Brighton, with Eden Hazard producing some magical moments.The big question is whether Arsenal can defend. They've done it in the two meetings at Stamford Bridge this season, where they looked to suffocate Chelsea, but at the Emirates it was very different, when they conceded twice and Alvaro Morata should have had a hat full.How do you keep Hazard quiet? I don't think you can really try to at home without having a negative mentality, and I think Arsene Wenger will go with a similar side to Saturday with Mohamed Elneny, Granit Xhaka and Jack Wilshere giving us a bit more control of the midfield.I'm really looking forward to sitting back and watching this game, just like I was with Liverpool v Manchester City, and I think it will be an exciting encounter, but I fear Hazard will hand out the decisive punishment.Charlie predicts: 2-3 and Hazard to score first - 85/1 with Sky Bet"
