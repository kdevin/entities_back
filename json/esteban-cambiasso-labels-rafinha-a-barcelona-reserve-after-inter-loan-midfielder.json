  "description": "Inter Milan have announced the loan signing of Barcelona midfielder Rafinha until the end of the season, with a view to a permanent move.",
  "content": "The midfielder has agreed a move to the San Siro until June 30, when Inter can buy the player for 35 million euros (Â£31m) plus add-ons.The 24-year-old has struggled to cement his place in the Barca team since making his debut in November 2011.Rafinha has recently recovered from a knee injury he sustained in April, playing 12 minutes in his first match of the season in the 1-0 Copa del Rey defeat at Espanyol last week.The signing has not gone down too well with former midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, who spent 10 years at Inter, who told Sky Italy: \"With Rafinha, it must be said that Inter are bringing in a Barcelona reserve.\"Therefore, an interesting player has arrived, but (Barca) have only given him to them because he's not been playing. That's the truth.\""
