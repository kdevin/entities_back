Olivier Giroud's move from Arsenal to London rivals Chelsea was also discussed with the panel weighing in on whether his arrival will help or hinder Alvaro Morata and debating why Antonio Conte still seems far from content with a squad which has seen Giroud, Emerson Palmieri and Ross Barkley added to it this month.Riyad Mahrez saw a potential deadline day move to Manchester City collapse with the Premier League leaders unwilling to match Leicester City's £95m valuation of the Algerian attacker. The panel discussed where he stands now after handing in a transfer window request for a second consecutive window and failing to force a move and whether Manchester City's squad is deep enough to compete in four competitions.Finally, the panel crunched the numbers on a January window which shattered the previous record and selected their best signings, biggest surprises, biggest winners and biggest losers from an action-packed month."
