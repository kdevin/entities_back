  "description": "Jurgen Klopp has told Liverpool fans to forget about the Â£75m transfer fee they paid for Virgil van Dijk and instead focus on his quality.",
  "content": "Van Dijk will complete his move to Anfield on January 1 after Liverpool agreed to pay Southampton a world-record sum for a defender.When asked what the 26-year-old will bring to the club, Klopp told Sky Sports: \"Quality. That's why we got him, that's why we were interested in him. It's quite difficult at the moment because technically he's still a Southampton player.\"We don't make the prices, the market does. Liverpool supporters should forget about the price.\"We only talk about the player and what he can bring in; the quality, the mentality, the character. That is why we are really happy about it.\"Van Dijk handed in a transfer request last summer in an attempt to force a move to Liverpool, only for Southampton to report the Reds for an alleged illegal approach.The Netherlands international has made 12 appearances for Saints this season after recovering from a long-term knee injury and Klopp has called for patience as he acclimatises to Liverpool's style of play.\"Virgil hasn't had the best first half to the season at Southampton,\" said Klopp.\"He was out injured for a long time and we all know about the things that happened last summer.\"He's a tall player - they always need a little bit longer especially after being out for around nine months - but that's no problem. We already have quality here in that position so we don't have to rush anything.\"He needs to adapt to our style of play. It's a completely different game, but we are 100 per cent sure he will do it.\"",
