  "description": "Jose Mourinho has reassured Manchester United supporters that he is happy in the north of England and has explained his decision to live in a hotel in Salford, rather than a permanent home in the city.",
  "content": "Mourinho has lived out of an apartment at the Lowry Hotel since first becoming United manager in 2016, and the former Chelsea boss has been forced to play down suggestions he is unhappy in Manchester.However, the Portuguese - who is midway through a three-year contract - insists he is content at Old Trafford and says his decision to not buy a house in Manchester does not reflect his commitment to the club.\"If the fans want me to be comfortable, then that's the way I feel very comfortable, because I am very lazy and because I like to arrive in the hotel,\" said Mourinho, speaking at a press conference ahead of United's FA Cup third-round tie against Derby County on Friday.\"I don't want anyone to be worried about me living in a two-square metre room. I am living in an apartment inside of a hotel where I have all the comfort and support, where I have everything that I want, like I'm living in a house.\"So if they are worried about me being comfortable and happy and supported, I really am.\"If they want me to be in some house that I don't like, lonely and away from my assistants, then I could do this for them. But then I would be a sad guy and a sad guy doesn't work well.\""
