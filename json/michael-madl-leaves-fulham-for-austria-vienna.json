  "description": "Defender Michael Madl has left Fulham to return to his native Austria with Austria Vienna for an undisclosed fee.",
  "content": "Madl initially arrived at Craven Cottage during the 2015/16 season on loan from Sturm Graz, and his impressive performances warranted a permanent transfer in the summer of 2016.The 29-year-old had made just two appearances this season, both in the Carabao Cup, and had made 32 appearances in his two-year spell in West London.As well as his limited playing time in the first team, Madl made one appearance for the U21 team in the Checkatrade Trophy this campaign.Madl said: \"I'm super happy that I'm back at my club. I believe that Austria has been on a very good path for many years now, and this is where the future is good. We have some plans.\"The Austrian leaves Slavisa Jokanovic's side in eighth position, just a point behind Sheffield United who occupy the final play-off place."
