  "description": "Paul Lambert has been appointed as the new Stoke City manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal. ",
  "content": "Lambert's appointment comes just over a week after the Potters sacked Mark Hughes in the wake of their FA Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Coventry.The Premier League club were linked with a host of managers after Hughes' departure, but saw Gary Rowett sign a new deal at Derby and were then turned down by Quique Sanchez Flores and Martin O'Neill.Lambert has signed a deal until the summer of 2020 and will be presented to the media at the bet365 Stadium on Tuesday.The Scot has been out of work since the end of last season when he left Wolves after \"a football review\" and was replaced by Nuno Espirito Santo.Lambert, who has also managed Livingston, Wycombe, Colchester, Norwich City, Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers, will watch their Monday Night Football clash with Manchester United from the stands at Old Trafford with Eddie Niedzwiecki taking charge of the team.Chairman Peter Coates said: \"Paul greatly impressed us with his knowledge of our squad and had a clear plan of how he would improve our results.\"He's a man who backed himself as a player, none more so than when he turned down contract offers in Scotland to go on trial in the German Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund, and it's obvious he adopts the same approach as a manager.\"Vice-chairman John Coates added: \"Paul has been successful in management at clubs with a strong and stable background and with local ownership - the kind of foundation we are able to give to our managers.\"We were determined to appoint someone with Premier League experience or an extensive knowledge of English football. We look forward to working with Paul and supporting him to help achieve our goals.\""
