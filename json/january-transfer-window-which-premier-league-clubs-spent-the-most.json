  "description": "Premier League clubs spent a record £419.5m during the January transfer window - but how much did your team spend?",
  "content": "The total expenditure almost doubled the previous winter record of £225m set in 2011, while Arsenal, Brighton, Huddersfield, Liverpool, Manchester City, Southampton and Swansea all set new transfer fee records.Liverpool, spent the most this January with an outlay of £75.2m, having signed Virgil van Dijk from Southampton for £75m and Tony Gallacher from Falkirk for £200,000.Arsenal were the next biggest spenders with £61.8m spent, parting £60m for Borussia Dortmund forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, in addition to PAS Giannina defender Konstantinos Mavropanos for £1.8m.Manchester City missed out on Alexis Sanchez and Riyad Mahrez, but landed 23-year-old Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte in the closing stages of the window for a club-record £57m and snapped up Jack Harrison from MLS side New York City for £4m.Other spendthrift clubs included Chelsea (£57.6m), Everton (£47m), Leicester City (£26.4m) and Tottenham (£25m).In contrast, Bournemouth, Burnley, Manchester United, Newcastle and West Ham did not spend a penny on permanent transfers during the window, although Manchester United swapped Henrikh Mkhitaryan for Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez.Van Dijk was the most expensive acquisition in the Premier League, followed by Aubameyang, Laporte, Cenk Tosun (£27m to Everton), Lucas Moura (£25m to Spurs), Emerson (£24.6m to Chelsea), Adrien Silva (£22m to Leicester) and Theo Walcott (£20m to Everton).Only seven Premier League clubs received funds from player sales.In addition to spending the most, Liverpool also received the most, collecting a window-high £146.2m from Barcelona for Philippe Coutinho and another £200,000 from the sale of Cameron Brannagan to Oxford United.Southampton were the next biggest beneficiaries from sales, cashing in £75m for Van Dijk, followed by Chelsea's £57m for striker Diego Costa, whose move to Atletico Madrid finally went through on January 1.Arsenal collected £50m from Walcott, Olivier Giroud (£18m) and Francis Coquelin (£12m), while West Ham received £26m for Andre Ayew (£18m) and Diafra Sakho (£8).Everton offloaded Ross Barkley for a comparatively low £15m and Liam Walsh to Bristol City for £1m, while West Brom received £2.5m from Leeds for Tyler Roberts.Only three clubs made a net profit from transfers during the window, with Liverpool making the most with £71m - after Coutinho's sale mitigated the record signing of Van Dijk - followed by Southampton (£55.9m) and West Ham (£26m).Manchester City recorded the greatest loss with -£61m from player sales, while Everton (-(£31m), Leicester (-£26.4m), Stoke (-£25m), Swansea (-£18m), Brighton (-£14.1m), Huddersfield (-£12m) and Arsenal (-£11.8m) all fell seven digits in the red.Premier League clubs signed 48 players in total with Watford and Stoke both making four additions - including loans - while Newcastle, Chelsea, West Brom, Arsenal, Brighton, Swansea, Leicester and Everton all made three acquisitions.Liverpool, West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United, Crystal Palace, Huddersfield and Manchester City all made two signings during the window.Southampton and Tottenham were frugal with incomings, only signing Guido Carrillo and Moura, respectively, while Bournemouth were the only club not to make at least one signing.There were 151 outgoings, with Arsenal offloading a league-high 15 players, followed by Liverpool (12), Everton (11), Newcastle, Manchester City (both 10), Watford, Chelsea and West Brom (all nine).West Ham, Huddersfield, Tottenham and Bournemouth all allowed seven players to leave, followed by Manchester United (six), Brighton, Leicester, Burnley (all five).Crystal Palace and Southampton only parted company, either permanently or temporarily on loan, with four players - with Stoke shedding a league-low three players from their roster."
