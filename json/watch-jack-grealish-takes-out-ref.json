  "description": "Referee Scott Duncan took a tumble after a barge from Jack Grealish during Aston Villaâ€™s 3-1 win over Barnsley at Villa Park.",
  "content": "But it's not quite as sinister as it sounds. As the Villa midfielder exchanged passes with Conor Hourihane, Duncan found himself caught in the crossfire and Grealish was taking no prisoners.Grealish maintained his momentum and did raise an apologetic hand before he managed to get the return pass back to its intended target; Hourihane then squared for the waiting Scott Hogan before the Barnsley backline cleared the danger.Steve Bruce's men failed to replicate their rampant first half, but mustered another three points towards their promotion challenge at Villa Park.Click on the video above to see Grealish's barge on referee Scott Duncan."
