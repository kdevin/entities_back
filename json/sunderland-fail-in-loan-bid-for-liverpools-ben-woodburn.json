  "description": "Sunderland have failed in their attempt to take Liverpool youngster Ben Woodburn on loan until the end of the season, Sky Sports News understands.",
  "content": "Manager Chris Coleman had been hoping to sign the attacking midfielder, who he has worked with before at international level with Wales.Sunderland had made contact with the Reds but any potential move was put on hold following the sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona.Jurgen Klopp is now keen to keep hold of the 18-year-old in order to maintain depth in the attacking area of his team, as the Premier League campaign enters its final five months.Woodburn will remain at Anfield unless Liverpool bring in any more forward players during the current window.An early move for Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita was suggested, though the Bundesliga side came out publicly to quell rumours and reaffirm that the Guinean would only be joining the Reds in the summer, as stipulated in the original agreement.Woodburn has made an impression on Merseyside since being handed his first-team debut by Klopp last season, though has found opportunities limited since.It was Coleman who selected Woodburn for his international debut for Wales, in a World Cup Qualifier against Austria in September 2017, in which he scored a long distance effort to help his country win the match 1-0."
