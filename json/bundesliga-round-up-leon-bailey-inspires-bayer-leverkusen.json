  "description": "Leon Bailey's backheel set Bayer Leverkusen on their way to an emphatic 4-1 win at Hoffenheim which moved them up to second place in the Bundesliga.",
  "content": "The highly-rated Jamaican produced an impudent finish in the 43rd minute to put the visitors in front.Following an attack down the right, he received the ball around the penalty spot with his back to goal and took goalkeeper Oliver Baumann by surprise with his quick thinking.Julian Baumgartlinger doubled the lead six minutes after the break and Lucas Alario made it three.Adam Szalai scored a late consolation for Hoffenheim, but there was still time for Alario to grab his second.Victory moved Leverkusen level on points with RB Leipzig, who conceded twice in five minutes to throw away a 1-0 lead to lose 2-1 at Freiburg.Timo Werner's fine solo goal broke the deadlock in the 66th minute as the Germany forward cut inside from the right and drilled a low shot into the corner from just outside the area.But Janik Haberer equalised in the 72nd minute and Robin Koch turned the match on its head by heading home the winner.Leipzig's loss means Bayern Munich can extend their lead at the top to 16 points with victory at home to Werder Bremen on Sunday.Borussia Monchengladbach moved up to fourth as Matthias Ginter's 10th-minute goal, a day after his 24th birthday, and Thorgan Hazard's last-gasp strike secured a 2-0 home win over Augsburg.Two goals from Yoshinori Muto helped struggling Mainz come from behind to beat Stuttgart 3-2.The hosts trailed to Holger Badstuber's 20th-minute goal, but Muto levelled on the stroke of half-time and struck again in the 54th minute.Gerrit Holtmann added the third before Daniel Ginczek got a late second for Stuttgart.Eintracht Frankfurt scored twice in the first half through Sebastien Haller and Timothy Chandler on their way to a 3-1 win at Wolfsburg.Maximilian Arnold halved the deficit in the 66th minute, but the Wolves had Nany Dimata sent off a minute later and Luka Jovic wrapped up the points."
