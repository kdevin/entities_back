  "description": "Atletico Madrid defender Diego Godin has undergone reconstructive procedure on his mouth after losing some of his teeth in a collision in La Liga on Sunday.",
  "content": "The club says Godin underwent the procedure in a dental clinic in Madrid, following the team's 1-0 home win over Valencia at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium.\nGodin had to be replaced early in the second half after colliding with Valencia goalkeeper Neto while going for a high cross into the area.\nNeto's elbow appeared to hit Godin directly on his face, and replays showed one of Godin's teeth flying out of his mouth. The Uruguay defender bled profusely as some of his teeth were visibly out of place.\nAtletico workers were reportedly sent to the field after the game to try to find his teeth.\nAtletico, nine points behind league leader Barcelona, had already lost central defender Stefan Savic before half-time because of a muscle injury on his left thigh.\nAtletico did not say how long the defenders will be sidelined for.\n",
