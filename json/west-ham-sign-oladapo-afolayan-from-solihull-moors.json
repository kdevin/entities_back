Afolayan.\"I started out with Chelsea and was there until I was 15, then my family moved to Canada and I was part of the Academy at Toronto FC.\"Then, when we moved back, I studied civil engineering at Loughborough University before the opportunity arose to join Solihull and play in the National League and it was something I couldn't turn down.\"Now, the opportunity has come to join a Premier League club and West Ham is one which has always given youngsters opportunities to come through, as we have seen this season, so I've come here to get into the first team and make a name for myself.\""
