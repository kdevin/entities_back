  "description": "The Football Association has asked Arsene Wenger to explain comments he made about refereeing decisions during pre and post-match news conferences for the game against Chelsea.",
  "content": "Wenger criticised referee Anthony Taylor following Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, describing his decision to award Chelsea a penalty as \"farcical\".Jack Wilshere had given Arsenal the lead in the 63rd-minute but Chelsea were handed a route back into the game four minutes after when Hector Bellerin was penalised for a foul on Eden Hazard.Speaking after the game, Wenger told Sky Sports of his disappointment at the decision: \"After that, we got again a farcical decision and mentally we were shocked.\"Then we could have lost the game but we had the resources to come back, and in the end maybe it's a fair result.\"When you come here you see football, and unfortunately the games are always spoiled by factors you can't master.\"We can only continue to play the way we want to play, and hope at one stage things will go for us.\"The FA request comes after the Arsenal boss was on Tuesday charged following his conduct in the referee's changing room after his side drew 1-1 with West Brom on Sunday.Wenger was left frustrated after Arsenal conceded a controversial late penalty at The Hawthorns, as Calum Chambers was judged to have handled the ball in the area.Speaking ahead of the Chelsea game, Wenger revealed his disappointment at a number of decisions from this season and described them as a \"concerning coincidence\".He said: \"It was very disappointing in the way it happened. I must say what is more frustrating for me is that it happened many times this season - at Stoke, at Watford, at Manchester City, at West Brom.\"Wenger has until 6pm on Tuesday, January 9 to respond."
