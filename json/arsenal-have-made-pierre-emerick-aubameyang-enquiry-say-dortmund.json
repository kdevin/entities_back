  "description": "Arsenal have made their first enquiry about Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, according to the Bundesliga club.",
  "content": "Dortmund's chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke confirmed the Gunners had made an approach for the Gabon international, who has been left out of the squad for his side's last two games.Watzke said: \"I can confirm that there has been a first enquiry from Arsenal for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\"However, he refused to discuss whether or not the north London club had made an offer, or if Dortmund had set a valuation for the player.German football magazine Kicker reported that Arsenal had submitted an official offer in the region of â‚¬50m, an amount which they say would not be acceptable to Dortmund.Aubameyang is under contract at Signal Iduna Park until 2021.The 28-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Arsenal as a potential replacement for Alexis Sanchez, who is expected to move to Manchester United.Aubameyang was the Bundesliga's leading goalscorer last season, finishing the campaign with 31 goals and has hit 13 in 15 games this term.However, he has been suspended twice by Dortmund this season for disciplinary reasons and sporting director Michael Zorc revealed last week he was not focused enough to play.Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was accused of being \"disrespectful\" by Zorc when he spoke about the links with Aubameyang last week."
