  "description": "Pep Guardiola took charge of his 500th game as a head coach as Manchester City beat Bristol City 3-2 on Tuesday night to take their place in the Carabao Cup final.",
  "content": "Leroy Sane, Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne were on target for City as they clinched a 5-3 aggregate victory over their Championship opponents at Ashton Gate.\nGuardiola, whose senior managerial career began at Barcelona with a 4-0 win in a Champions League qualifier against Polish side Wisla Krakow in August 2008, will now hope to win his first piece of silverware in England. Here is his record so far...\nThe win over Bristol City was Guardiola's 65th in 92 games in charge of Manchester City and his 368th overall.\nThe 47-year-old recorded 179 of those wins at Barcelona, but he actually recorded his highest win percentage at Bayern Munich, with 124 victories from 161 games giving him a success rate of 77 per cent.\nGuardiola is still waiting for his first trophy as Manchester City boss but he is already one of the most decorated coaches in history. The former midfielder has won 18 major trophies in total.\nThere were three La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and two FIFA Club World Cups at Barcelona, and he enjoyed similar success at Bayern, winning three Bundesliga titles, two German Cups, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup.\nWill the Carabao Cup be major trophy number 19?\nIt's no surprise that the six players to have made the most appearances under Guardiola all come from his Barcelona days. The Catalan spent four seasons in charge at the Nou Camp, with Lionel Messi leading the way on 219 games played.\nDani Alves and Xavi Hernandez are next on 208 games played under Guardiola, with Victor Valdes, Sergio Busquets and Seydou Keita next in the list with 199, 191 and 188 appearances respectively.\nMessi is well out in front for goals scored under Guardiola. His extraordinary total of 211 is nearly three times as many as any other player.\nThomas Muller is next having scored 79 times during Guardiola's three seasons in charge of Bayern Munich, with Robert Lewandowski (67) and Pedro (58) next on the list.\nSergio Aguero is City's top-scoring player under Guardiola having netted his 56th against Bristol City, putting him nine goals clear of Bayern winger Arjen Robben. The Argentine will now hope to overtake Pedro and Lewandowski before the season is out.\n",
