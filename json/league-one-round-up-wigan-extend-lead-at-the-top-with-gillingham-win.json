  "description": "Wigan extended their lead at the top of League One after downing Gillingham, while nearest challengers Blackburn saw their 18-match unbeaten run ended by Plymouth.",
  "content": "Rovers had not lost a league game since October, but they came unstuck at Home Park following first-half goals from Ruben Lameiras and Ryan Taylor.That result allowed Wigan to move two points clear at the summit with their 2-0 win over Gillingham, where Will Grigg was again on the scoresheet.Shrewsbury moved into the top two above Blackburn after snatching a late 2-1 victory at Bristol Rovers. Scunthorpe closed the gap to third place to five points with an eventful 3-2 win at 10-man Fleetwood.Bradford crashed to their sixth successive defeat in all competitions after losing 2-1 at struggling Oldham, Cameron Dummigan and Aaron Holloway were on the scoresheet before Jordan Gibson netted a late consolation.Rotherham took advantage of that result to leapfrog their Yorkshire rivals into fifth place as goals from Michael Smith and David Ball earned them a 2-0 win over AFC Wimbledon.Managerless Oxford twice fought back from behind to claim a dramatic 3-2 win over Charlton, with Todd Kane and Ryan Ledson netting in the dying moments of a match which saw all five goals scored in the final half-hour.Doncaster also twice let the lead slip at Fratton Park where Portsmouth battled back for a 2-2 draw. James Coppinger and John Marquis struck for Rovers with new loan signing Anton Walkes and Brett Pitman responding for Pompey, who had Christian Burgess dismissed late on.At the other end of the table, rock-bottom Bury salvaged a 1-1 with Blackpool as George Miller netted an 83rd-minute equaliser after Sean Longstaff had put the visitors ahead.Calvin Andrew's goal earned Rochdale their first away win of the campaign, Northampton the victims, while there were also 1-0 wins for Walsall and Southend.Walsall defeated MK Dons thanks to Julien Ngoy's effort while an early Jason Demetriou penalty earned Southend victory at Peterborough.",
