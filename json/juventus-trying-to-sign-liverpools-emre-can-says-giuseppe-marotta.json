  "description": "Juventus director general Giuseppe Marotta says the Serie A champions are trying \"all they can\" to sign Emre Can from Liverpool.",
  "content": "The 24-year-old's contract with Liverpool runs out on June 30, meaning he is free to sign a pre-contract agreement with a club outside of the Premier League.Sky sources understand Can is set to hold further talks with Liverpool this month regarding his future, but Juventus are trying to convince him Turin is the best place for him to develop.\"Emre Can is a player whose contract is running down, so it allows us to approach him for negotiations and that is the course we have taken,\" Marotta told Sky Sport Italia.\"I can't say if he could sign a new contract with Liverpool, but I can say we will try all we can to get the player. Obviously, we have to respect what the player wants.\"The Germany international reached an impasse with Liverpool during the previous set of negotiations, with the stumbling block believed to be the Reds' reluctance to break their club precedent and insert a buy-out clause into any new deal.Can's development since his Â£9.75m move to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen in 2014 saw him grow in stature on the international scene and become a regular in the Germany set-up.Speaking recently of his future, Can outlined his dedication to Liverpool while maintaining he was still in talks with several parties.\"My agent is looking after everything but I am here until the summer. I haven't signed anything (with Juventus) or anyone,\" said Can.\"I am talking with everyone, of course I am talking with Liverpool. Why not? I still have a contract here. It is an amazing club. What can I say? My agent does the rest.\""
