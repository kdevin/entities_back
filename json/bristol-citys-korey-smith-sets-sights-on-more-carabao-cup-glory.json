I appreciate all the messages and love I got after it.\"But I just think it was a great moment for the city as a whole, it brought people together and we'll always remember that moment in the future.\"This game is over two legs so it's a little bit different, you've probably got to use your head a little bit more.\"But as long as we bring it back to Ashton Gate with a good scoreline we've got every chance.\"Bristol City are riding high in fourth place in the Championship, but have lost their last three games.They suffered back-to-back league defeats for the first time and went out of the FA Cup at Watford on Saturday when Johnson fielded an under-strength side with the trip to Manchester in mind.",
