  "description": "Bristol City hero Korey Smith is determined to produce another Carabao Cup shock when they play Manchester City on Tuesday night.",
  "content": "Smith scored a 90th-minute winner against Manchester United last month to set up a two-legged semi-final with runaway Premier League leaders City, live on Sky Sports Football.The first leg will be at the Etihad Stadium and the Robins midfielder believes it is a great chance for the club to create more special moments.\"We're under no illusions about the tie as they are probably one of the best clubs in Europe, if not the world at the moment,\" Smith said.\"They are playing unbelievably well and they've got great players, but we know in football that anything's possible.\"We've got a lot of respect for them - they have an amazing team with an amazing manager - but it's a massive opportunity to make a special moment again.\"Bristol City, under Lee Johnson's leadership, have beaten four Premier League sides to reach the semi-final of a major cup competition for the first time since the 1988-89 season.Watford, Stoke and Crystal Palace were all eliminated before the Robins beat United 2-1 in the quarter-final and Smith claimed folk-hero status.\"It was crazy,\" Smith added. \"I heard people had me on top of their Christmas tree! I appreciate all the messages and love I got after it.\"But I just think it was a great moment for the city as a whole, it brought people together and we'll always remember that moment in the future.\"This game is over two legs so it's a little bit different, you've probably got to use your head a little bit more.\"But as long as we bring it back to Ashton Gate with a good scoreline we've got every chance.\"Bristol City are riding high in fourth place in the Championship, but have lost their last three games.They suffered back-to-back league defeats for the first time and went out of the FA Cup at Watford on Saturday when Johnson fielded an under-strength side with the trip to Manchester in mind."
