  "description": "Danny Rose's knee injury is not considered serious, Sky Sports News understands.",
  "content": "The Tottenham left-back has suffered a minor reaction after an injury in his left knee kept him out for 10 months earlier this year.Rose is continuing to be assessed by the Spurs medical team but remains a doubt for Sunday's FA Cup third-round clash with AFC Wimbledon at Wembley.The England international, whose long-term future at Tottenham remains uncertain, suffered the problem after completing 90 minutes in the 5-2 win over Southampton on Boxing Day.Rose subsequently missed the win at Swansea and Thursday's 1-1 draw with West Ham in the Premier League.Rose has played only nine times for Tottenham this season, including just five starts in the league, having returned from his knee injury in October.He has patched up his relationship with manager Mauricio Pochettino following his summer outburst, but Spurs are understood to have been assessing potential replacements, with Fulham's Ryan Sessegnon the top target and Manchester United's Luke Shaw next on the list."
