  "description": "Southampton are interested in signing Spartak Moscow winger Quincy Promes, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "It is understood the player is keen on a move to England, but Spartak are holding out for a fee in the region of £30m.Any deal would likely eclipse Southampton's current £18.1m club-record fee paid for midfielder Mario Lemina from Juventus last summer.Promes has scored 53 goals in 101 Russian Premier League appearances for Spartak after joining them from FC Twente in August 2014 for a reported £12m.The 26-year-old, who is under contract in Moscow until June 2021, was key in Spartak's league title win last season and was named the Russian Premier League footballer of the year for 2017.Amsterdam-born Promes has been capped 25 times by the Netherlands, scoring four goals with three of those coming in the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.He has been linked with a move to Liverpool and their manager Jurgen Klopp compared him to Sadio Mane when his side played Spartak in the Champions League this season, saying \"he can shoot very quickly and is a proper striker\"."
