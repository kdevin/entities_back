  "content": "Our friends at Football Whispers have scoured the continental media for the latest news and transfer rumours.Out of favour at Liverpool, Daniel Sturridge has offered himself to Inter on a six-month loan deal. (Tuttosport)Atalanta forward Alejandro Gomez could be tempted by a January approach from Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp is thought to be a fan of the 29-year-old, who's in the form of his life with seven goals and eight assists this season. (Tuttosport)Liverpool midfielder Emre Can has turned down offers from Bayern Munich and Manchester City, instead agreeing to join Juventus when his contract is up at the end of the season. (Tuttosport)Former Chelsea man Andre Schurrle, who has been the subject of West Ham transfer rumours, is on Inter's wish-list for January. The Italian side want the Dortmund forward, as well as Barcelona midfielder Rafinha. (Gazzetta dello Sport)Olivier Giroud isn't interested in a move to Turkey or China according to his agent, Michael Manuello, who told Le Figaro: \"He will listen and look [at the offers for him] and then he will see. Leaving just to leave is pointless. It has to make sense and give him something extra. He will have playing time at Arsenal, the second part of the season is important and there are a number of competitions to play in, even if he only plays in the Europa League.\" He added: \"Leaving to earn more money is now what's important in his mind.\" (Le Figaro)With Lucas Moura subject of Manchester United transfer interest, Paris Saint-Germain have put a €40m (£35m) asking price on the Brazilian. (Le Parisien)Manchester United full-back Matteo Darmian is a Benfica transfer target. The Portuguese club believe they can get the 28-year-old on loan until the end of the season. (A Bola)Anderlecht general manager Herman Van Holsbeeck has told DH that Leander Dendoncker could leave the club, with West Ham a possible destination, saying: \"[Dendoncker] is highly courted, notably by West Ham. If you let go of your centrepiece, it must be for a lot of money and we must also be able to find someone to replace him, even for six months via a loan.\" When asked if it could be done, he added: \"If there's €25m (£22m) or €30m (£26.5m) on the table, it can be done, yes.\" (DH)Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga's future is up in the air. The 23-year-old looked set to join Real Madrid for €20m (£17.6m) after undergoing a medical. But coach Zinedine Zidane doesn't want to sign a new goalkeeper in January. Arrizabalaga is out of contract in the summer and has turned down a new deal at the San Mames, meaning there's a real possibility if he stays at the club, he will be frozen out. With the World Cup around the corner, he may try and push for a move to another club rather than be out of favour in Bilbao and wait for Real Madrid in the summer. (Marca)Dani Ceballos can't return to Real Betis this January despite being barely used at Real Madrid. Spanish regulations say a player can't be re-registered for a club in the same 12-month period from July to June. The midfielder joined Madrid from Betis in mid-July. (Marca)Real Betis midfielder Fabian is being watched by Barcelona, with the Catalan club impressed by what they have seen. They are unlikely to bring him in this January though, as they are wary of signing too many midfielders at once after the arrival of Philippe Coutinho. (Mundo Deportivo)Former Arsenal transfer target Arda Turan is set to leave Barcelona for Istanbul Basaksehir in the next 48 hours. The two clubs have agreed an €8m (£7m) fee. (Mundo Deportivo)Former Manchester United forward Bebe could move from Eibar to Las Palmas this month. (Marca)Guangzhou Evergrande have denied reports that they have agreed a fee for Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. (SportBild)"
