  "description": "It's a mixed bag of games for the experts to predict on LaLiga Matchday 19 of the #RevistaPredictor, as David Garrido explains.",
  "content": "Now is the time the mettle of La Liga teams gets tested, with midweek Copa del Rey matches between their league fixtures, and the Predictor has offered up a trio of games which would test even the sharpest minds, involving two teams towards the top, two in mid-table and two in the relegation battle...MATCH 1 - GIRONA v LAS PALMASGirona have suffered a couple of defeats on the bounce, both away from home - a surprise given how well they had done on the road this season, but given that Las Palmas are so awful home and away, none of us can see them getting anything here. Paco Jémez may be in charge now at the Estadio Gran Canaria, which means things will be more entertaining if not necessarily better. Even with a bit of new blood - the likes of Alejandro Gálvez on loan from Eibar, Jairo Samperio from Mainz, Gabriel Peñalba from Cruz Azul in Mexico - I cannot see them having any impact, and four of us have gone for Cristhian Stuani to open the scoring.MATCH 2 - DEPORTIVO v VALENCIADeportivo have been flirting with the relegation places for a little while now - and they could drop into them as a result of this game at El Riazor and if Alavés win at home to Sevilla. Pepe Mel's start to this campaign was pretty awful, but Cristóbal Parralo has not fared too much better - one win in eight in La Liga is testament to that. Valencia bounced back from their derby defeat to Villarreal before the Christmas break by beating Girona, and with Luciano Vietto and Francis Coquelin in the building, they are clearly looking to sustain a title challenge for as long as possible, or at least a push for the Champions League places. We have all gone for an away win here, but first goalscorer could be interesting with four different choices made by the pundits.MATCH 3 - REAL SOCIEDAD v BARCELONAAnoeta is a venue where Barcelona have not won in La Liga since May 2007, so more than a decade. La Real always seem to lift their game for the visit of the Catalans, even if they are in poor form by their standards with two wins in eight league games and a loss at Leganés last time out. It means they are a lowly 12th, and closer to the relegation places than the top four. Rob Palmer is the only expert to go against the grain here, but we love it when Rob goes rogue...he thinks Willian José will score first and that the hosts will get a point - the rest of us disagree, and say Barcelona will extend their unbeaten run in all competitions this season to 29 games with another victory.The overall standings are still relatively spread out, making a correct first goalscorer even more valuable to make up ground.Don't forget to send us your predictions on Twitter, tagging us in @SkyRevista and using the hashtag #RevistaPredictor - you have until 12pm GMT on Saturday to do so. Enjoy!"
