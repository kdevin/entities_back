  "description": "Marouane Fellaini remains in talks with Manchester United over a new contract, Sky Sports News understands.",
  "content": "The Belgium midfielder is free to negotiate with clubs abroad as his current deal at Old Trafford runs out at the end of the 2017-18 season.Reports on Tuesday morning suggested that Fellaini, who has been with United since September 2013, had told boss Jose Mourinho that he wanted to leave the Premier League club.But Sky Sports News understands that no decision has yet been made from either side over the 30-year-old's future in Manchester.Fellaini has been linked with a move to Turkey with Galatasaray and Besiktas, while there has also been reported interest from clubs in China.He returned to action off the bench last Friday, playing 10 minutes in the FA Cup third round win over Derby County, having been out since November 25 with a knee injury.Fellaini said last month he did not know what his future held and expected a new contract offer to materialise.\"I'm still here. If Manchester did not want me anymore, they would have said that for a long time. They made a proposal, probably one will follow,\" he said.\"Whether I will accept it I do not know. You cannot arrange something like that in a jiffy.\""
