I think it's a big opportunity to play my first minutes this season in the Premier League.\"Everyone is shocked because Burnley is just after the big six. They have played very well. I watched the last game against Liverpool when they played very well and were unlucky.\"That's why I have come here, to find football. I knew he (Sean Dyche) is a big manager who likes young players and players who go forward, so it suits my character to come here and I am happy to work with him.\"I hope to help the club. If I can, I will. But the last word is with the manager. If he puts me on the pitch I will do everything to help the team go forward.\"I am ready to play and waiting on the starting blocks. If the manager puts me on the pitch I will do everything on the pitch.\"N'Koudou has struggled to make an impact over 18 months at Spurs. He has made 23 appearances since arriving from Marseille in 2016 but never started a Premier League match."
