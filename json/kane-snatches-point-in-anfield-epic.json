  "title": "Liverpool 2-2 Tottenham: Harry Kane nets last-gasp penalty in Anfield epic",
  "description": "Harry Kane scored an injury-time penalty after missing an earlier one for Tottenham to salvage a 2-2 draw in an extraordinary clash with Liverpool at Anfield on Super Sunday.",
  "content": "Liverpool were leading 1-0 with 12 minutes left after Mohamed Salah's opener but Victor Wanyama thumped Spurs level before Kane won a penalty on 85 minutes.\nHowever, the England international spurned the opportunity and Salah sensationally put Liverpool in front in injury time with an exquisite solo effort.\nThat looked the end of the drama but Spurs won a second penalty with their final attack when the linesman overruled referee Jon Moss for a Virgil van Dijk challenge on Erik Lamela.\nIn front of a disgruntled home crowd, Kane made no mistake to become the player to reach 100 Premier League goals in the second-shortest time.\nWith just three minutes gone, Liverpool's high press forced Eric Dier into a horrendous back-pass which was seized upon by Salah, who was presented with an easy finish past Hugo Lloris from 10 yards out.\nTottenham looked rocked by the early goal as Liverpool continued to play with energy through Jordan Henderson and James Milner in midfield - however, the second goal evaded them with Milner and Roberto Firmino skewing shots wide after some creative play by Trent Alexander-Arnold.\nAfter the break Spurs started to find their rhythm and ask questions of Liverpool defensively.\nThe atmosphere around Anfield was becoming nervy with their team dropping deeper and Klopp switched to a back five for the final 10 minutes in order to see the game out.\nHis defensive tactic didn't reap the required effect as Spurs levelled in spectacular fashion. Eriksen's cross from the left was palmed clear by Karius into the path of Wanyama, who struck a quite breath-taking half-volley into the top corner.\nThe drama wasn't done there as Spurs won a penalty in the 85th minute as Kane nipped through and went down under minimal contact from Karius.\nThe script seemed set for the England international to net his 100th Premier League goal but his penalty was straight down the middle and Karius blocked it away.\nLiverpool then thought they'd won it when Salah somehow twisted and turned in the box, beating two Spurs defenders, and poked a fine finish into the net.\nWith Anfield rocking, the home fans' joy quickly turned to anger when Lamela was felled by Van Dijk inside the area. The referee originally waved away the appeals but the linesman flagged and Moss brought the play back to award the penalty.\nThis time Kane stayed cool and quite a bonkers match ended all square.\nJurgen Klopp: \"The result was massively influenced by the linesman's decisions.\n\"I am not allowed to go in their room until half an hour after the game, do you think the first thing he comes to me and tells me he made a mistake with the first penalty because it was clearly offside? Unbelievable.\"\nMauricio Pochettino: \"I've congratulated the referee. To show that sort of character. It was difficult to know at the time if they were right, but in the dressing room I confirmed that they were right in every single decision.\"\n\"Sometimes we complain about them - I don't - as I decided a long time ago to stop complaining. It's important to recognise when they are right because it's a very difficult job for them.\nThe mesmerising Egyptian took his tally for the Premier League season to 21 with two very different finishes. After being gifted the opener by a stray Dier back pass, his second was a thing of beauty.\nWith Liverpool struggling for ideas as the game ticked into added time, he twisted between two markers with an imperious piece of skill and poked home. It reminded many - including his manager - of a certain Argentinean playing for Barcelona. At this rate, he's not too far off his level.\nLiverpool are back in front of the Sky Sports cameras next Sunday when they visit Southampton, live on Sky Sports Premier League while Tottenham have a midweek FA Cup replay against Newport County on Wednesday before hosting Arsenal next Saturday lunchtime.\n",
