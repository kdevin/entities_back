He is not our player he just happens to be one of probably 100 names you could mention that I probably would [want].\n\"But he's not our player and neither is anybody else that might be thrown into the mix.\"\nDembele has been a revelation since joining Celtic following the expiry of his contract with Fulham 18 months ago.\nThe striker made 49 appearances in all competitions during his first season with the Hoops and scored 32 goals before his campaign was curtailed by a thigh injury.\nDembele missed the start of this season due to a hamstring injury and has scored eight goals in 19 appearances.\nThe 21-year-old came through the ranks at Paris Saint-Germain and joined Fulham in 2012.
