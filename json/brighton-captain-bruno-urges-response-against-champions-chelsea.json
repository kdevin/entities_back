  "content": "The Seagulls host the champions at the Amex Stadium on Saturday - live on Sky Sports Premier League - looking for their first points against a top-six side at the seventh attempt.\nBrighton, who have not won in the league since December 23, are in need of a positive result having allowed relegation rivals West Brom to close the gap on them to four points with a 2-0 victory at The Hawthorns on Saturday.\nAnd, speaking to Sky Sports, captain Bruno challenged his side to come back fighting after last week's setback.\n\"Sometimes to have a big disappointment is really good because that hurts you and makes you come back stronger,\" he said. \"It's going to be this way.\n\"Of course, we know that Chelsea is a top team but we need to get something from the top six. We haven't got anything yet.\n\"We're not desperate but we want to get something against the top six because they are extra points.\"\nRunaway league leaders Manchester City and second-place Manchester United edged tight games with Brighton this season, with only Liverpool inflicting a heavy defeat on Chris Hughton's men.\nBut with only bottom-of-the-table Swansea having scored less goals than Brighton this term, Bruno believes the Seagulls' ability to take their chances is key to their survival hopes.\n\"Against big teams we have been really close,\" he added. \"Against Manchester City, away at Manchester United.\n\"The only team we weren't close to was Liverpool at home because of their counter-attacks.\n\"But it's about taking chances, if you have one chance against them and it's 0-0, you have to take it - that's the main thing. Behind that needs to be a solid, solid performance.\"\nWatch Brighton v Chelsea on Saturday from 11.30am on Sky Sports Premier League.\n",
