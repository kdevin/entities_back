We haven't got anything yet.\"We're not desperate but we want to get something against the top six because they are extra points.\"Runaway league leaders Manchester City and second-place Manchester United edged tight games with Brighton this season, with only Liverpool inflicting a heavy defeat on Chris Hughton's men.But with only bottom-of-the-table Swansea having scored less goals than Brighton this term, Bruno believes the Seagulls' ability to take their chances is key to their survival hopes.\"Against big teams we have been really close,\" he added. \"Against Manchester City, away at Manchester United.\"The only team we weren't close to was Liverpool at home because of their counter-attacks.\"But it's about taking chances, if you have one chance against them and it's 0-0, you have to take it - that's the main thing. Behind that needs to be a solid, solid performance.\"Watch Brighton v Chelsea on Saturday from 11.30am on Sky Sports Premier League.",
