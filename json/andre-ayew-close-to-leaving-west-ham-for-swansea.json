  "description": "West Ham striker Andre Ayew is close to agreeing a deal with Swansea, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "It is understood Swansea have offered a deal worth up to £18m for Ayew, but West Ham are believed to be holding out for their £20m valuation of the Ghana international.There have been reports that West Ham want to sign Ki Sung-yueng as part of the deal but Swansea insist that will not happen as they need midfielders on their books having just sent Roque Mesa out on loan to Sevilla.West Ham boss David Moyes confirmed that Swansea have lodged a bid but he made it clear they need reinforcements before any sale can take place.The Hammers are short on bodies with 14 players out either through injury or suspension.It has been a frustrating transfer window so far for Swansea who have yet to bring anyone in but re-signing Ayew, who left the club in the summer of 2016, would be a boost Carlos Carvalhal.The Swans are also still in talks with Liverpool over a loan spell for Lazar Markovic.The deal appears to hinge on the player's willingness to join a relegation battle, with Wolfsburg also in the frame.Sky Sports News understands the German club was Markovic's preferred destination but Swansea are hopeful the player will change his mind after Tuesday night's 3-1 win over Arsenal lifted them out of the bottom three.Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund have pulled the plug on Andre Schurrle's two-year loan to Swansea because Andriy Yarmolenko was injured in training on Tuesday, according to Sky sources.Schurrle appears to be surplus to requirements at Dortmund and has started just two Bundesliga games this season.The former Chelsea midfielder has also been linked with Newcastle and West Brom in this window.",
