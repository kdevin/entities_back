  "description": "Ashley Williams says Everton cannot afford to think they are safe from relegation this season.",
  "content": "Everton currently sit ninth in the Premier League standings, six points clear of the drop zone, but have gone six matches without a win in all competitions.After an encouraging run of 12 points from a possible 18 in Sam Allardyce's first six games in charge, the Toffees have only picked up three points from as many games since.Williams says the club are in danger of being pulled back into the relegation battle if they do not manage to turn their form around.\"It's not good. The gaffer said he wanted a result to stop the losing streak [of four matches] so we did that but it's not good reading,\" said Williams.\"We need to win games and when teams are below us in the league, especially at home, they are the type of games you want to win.\"If you don't perform for periods of the season you're going to find yourself down there.\"Obviously with the results we have been getting we have started to slip the other way that you don't want to be going.\"I'm not sure if we are in a relegation battle or not but I don't think you're ever really out of it unless you are one of the top few teams.\"We have got to get back on track because we have to get back on track and perform better, get results, get clean sheets, win games and you will be alright if you do that.\"The 1-1 draw against West Brom on Saturday was marred by James McCarthy's double fracture of his right leg in a clash with Salomon Rondon which will require surgery and keep the midfielder out until well into next season.Williams says he had feelings of deja vu over a similar injury suffered by Everton teammate Seamus Coleman last summer in an international fixture between Ireland and Wales.\"We are gutted more than I could tell you. It is really bad,\" he said.\"It wasn't nice when it happened. I've been there with Seamus and other players.\"Once that happens it is difficult to pick yourself up after that to be honest. It is incomprehensible, especially to him with his recent history. It's a tough one.\"",
