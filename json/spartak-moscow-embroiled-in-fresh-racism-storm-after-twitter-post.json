  "description": "Spartak Moscow are at the centre of a racism storm after captioning a video of three black players training with the words \"see how the chocolates melt in the sun\".",
  "content": "The post, which has subsequently been deleted, was released on the club's official and verified Twitter account on Saturday and included emoji symbols of chocolate bars and a sunshine in the headline.The tweet comes just six months before Russia hosts its first ever World Cup, and one week after Liverpool officially complained to UEFA over alleged racist abuse aimed at Rhian Brewster from Spartak players in the U19 match in December.Spartak fans were also found guilty of abusing Liverpool's Bobby Adekanye during a Youth League fixture in Russia.Many Twitter users have condemned the tweet, with some urging FIFA and UEFA to take action.In response to the post, a statement from Kick It Out read: \"This social media post from the official account of Spartak Moscow only continues to highlight the prejudices towards black people in Russia.\"With the World Cup only a few months away, it is a reminder that Russia, as with the whole of football, has significant work to do to eradicate racism of all forms from the game.\""
