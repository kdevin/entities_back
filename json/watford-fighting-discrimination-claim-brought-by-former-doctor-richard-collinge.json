  "description": "Watford are being sued by the club's former doctor Richard Collinge on the grounds of discrimination.",
  "content": "Collinge was dismissed from his role in September 2016 less than two years into his second spell at Vicarage Road.His discrimination claim is based on the grounds of nationality and will be heard on September 13 - the hearing could last up to two weeks.Collinge first joined Watford in 2002 and spent nearly a decade at the club before following Malky Mackay to Cardiff - he would also go to Wigan when Mackay moved north.He rejoined the Hornets in 2015 and lost his job shortly after new boss Walter Mazzarri appointed six Italian compatriots to his backroom staff.Watford deny the allegations and, according to The Times, will argue his departure came after a decision was made to employ a permanent doctor during a restructure."
