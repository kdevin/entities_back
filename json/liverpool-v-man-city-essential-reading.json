We examine the stats on to see how best to beat Pep Guardiola's side.\nLiverpool's £75m signing Virgil van Dijk is set to start in Sunday's game. According to Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp, the former Southampton defender guarantees Liverpool's place in the top four this season.\n\"Everyone is vying for second place, but I think personally that by bringing in Van Dijk, you pretty much have cemented the top four with that one signing,\" he said. \"I do think he is going to make that big a difference.\"\nAccording to Thierry Henry, Liverpool could be the side to end Manchester City's unbeaten run.\nHenry also gave his verdict on Coutinho's departure. \"You still have Firmino, Salah, Mane - I mean, this is not a bad front three,\" he said. \"You would obviously prefer to have that front with Coutinho as a No 10.\n\"Oxlade-Chamberlain is there, Lallana is back, but obviously you are going to miss Coutinho. The amount of goals he has scored from outside the box is just ridiculous. You have to move on though and Liverpool will always be Liverpool.\"\nRead Thierry's full verdict here.\nI think Liverpool could be the team that finally beat Manchester City. I know Philippe Coutinho is not there anymore but they've still got the firepower to beat them, with Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. City haven't won at Anfield since 2003, although you've got to remember what City were like back then, they're not the team they are now that's for sure. But I fancy Liverpool - I didn't think I'd ever say that!\nPAUL PREDICTS: 2-1 (10/1 with Sky Bet)\nWho will come out on top between Van Dijk and Sergio Aguero? We look at the stats behind the key battle at Anfield.\nDoes Manchester City's record at Anfield provide hope for Liverpool?

The England international has been in outstanding form for Guardiola's side this season but what's behind his scoring streak?\nHow many of Arsenal's Invincibles would make it into the current Manchester City side? Pick your XI using our interactive team selector.\nThe Alexis Sanchez transfer saga is hanging over the fixture, with Manchester United now rivaling City to sign the Arsenal forward. According to Phil Neville, signing him from under City's noses would be an \"unbelievable coup\".\nWhich of these reported transfer targets would you like to see at Anfield?\nHave your say on who Guardiola should bring to the Etihad Stadium.\nWatch Liverpool v Manchester City live on Sky Sports Premier League HD from 3.30pm on Sunday\n",
