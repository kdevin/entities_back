For context, only three clubs have scored fewer in the Premier League: Swansea, Brighton and West Brom.Conversely, only three clubs have conceded fewer goals than Burnley this term: Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea - stats that highlight Tarkowski's impact on the Clarets' incredible run.The centre-back has won a remarkable 158 duels and 105 aerials, made 152 clearances, 33 tackles, 33 blocks and 32 interceptions.Power Ranking points: 31,738Runner-up: Nick Pope (29,900)Chelsea wing-back Marcos Alonso has scored six goals -

boosted by having played 300 additional minutes.Despite only scoring the once, Townsend has recorded four assists and taken 1,115 touches, creating 28 chances and firing a club-high 30 successful crosses.Power Ranking points: 25,885Runner-up: Wilfried Zaha (25,630)Rooney scored on his second league debut for Everton in August and fired an outrageous goal from the half-way line to cap a hat-trick against West Ham in November.The former England skipper has now scored 10 goals for the Toffees - seven more than any other player - and has recorded club-high totals for shots on target (14) and chances created (20) - stats that also suggest a lack of firepower at the club.Power Ranking points: 27,063Runner-up: Gylfi Sigurdsson (24,650)Aaron Mooy has pulled ahead of centre-back Christopher Schindler as Huddersfield's top player in recent weeks after a string of heavy defeats.The Australia international has made a big impact since joining the Terriers for £10m from Manchester City last summer, scoring four goals, recording two assists, creating 24 chances, making 1,007 successful passes, 68 tackles and 1,697 touches.Power Ranking points: 29,391Runner-up: Christopher Schindler (25,424)Riyad Mahrez has rekindled his title-winning form of two years ago in recent months and has seven goals - three from outside the box - and seven assists so far this season.The winger has taken more shots on target than any player at the club with 20 and he has club-high totals for dribbles completed (51) and successful crosses (16).Power Ranking points: 41,027Runner-up: Wilfried Ndidi (30,511)Mohamed Salah has hit the ground running at Anfield with 18 goals and six assists to date, catapulting him to the heady heights of runner-up in the overall Sky Sports Power Rankings' season chart.Like Mahrez, Salah has scored three from range and has club-high totals for shots on target (44), chances created (35) and dribbles completed (55).In term of Power Ranking points, there is no competition at Anfield: Salah's closest competitor, Roberto Firmino, has 17,000 fewer points.Power Ranking points: 56,123Runner-up: Roberto Firmino (39,078)Kevin De Bruyne has been in scintillated form this season, helping City to claim 18 successive wins and complete an undefeated run of 22 games before the 4-3 defeat at Anfield on Sunday.The Belgium international has topped the overall Sky Sports Power Rankings season chart for the majority of this season - but a recent dip in form has seen his lead over Salah slashed to just nine Power Ranking points.De Bruyne has six goals - four from outside the box - and nine assists to date, having taken a staggering 2,194 touches, and recording club-high totals for chances created (44) and successful crosses (40).Power Ranking points: 56,132Runner-up: Raheem Sterling (44,592)David de Gea has shone once again this season, staking his claim as the world's No 1 goalkeeper, with 13 clean sheets, 77 saves and conceding a league-low 16 goals.His position as United's top player this season may have been threatened by Paul Pogba, had the France international not missed seven league games through a hamstring injury and another three due to suspension.Power Ranking points: 39,030Runner-up: Romelu Lukaku (37,408)Perhaps surprisingly, Joselu narrowly emerges as the top player at Newcastle, with four goals and an assist - 898 points ahead of midfielder Mikel Merino.The Spaniard's conversion rate is impressive, having only mustered 16 shots on target, and he has club-high totals for duels won (153) and aerials won (119).Power Ranking points: 21,384Runner-up: Mikel Merino (20,486)Southampton have struggled to score goals again this season as Mauricio Pellegrino battles to keep his job at St Mary's, but Oriol Romeo has once again reigned supreme in the centre of the pitch.The midfielder has recorded club-high totals across a raft of defensive stats, including successful passes (1,039), touches (1,541), tackles (62), aerials won (53), interceptions (38) and duels won (140).Power Ranking points: 22,969Runner-up: Dusan Tadic (19,996)Unsurprisingly, Xherdan Shaqiri has been Stoke's top player during a sticky run of results that saw Mark Hughes sacked after four and a half years at the club.Shaqiri is the club's joint-top scorer with Eric Maxim Choup-Moting on four goals and has club-high totals with five assists, 19 shots on target and 23 chances created.Power Ranking points: 28,393Runner-up: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting (24,829)Despite Swansea's below-par form, Jordan Ayew has impressed with four goals and two assists.
