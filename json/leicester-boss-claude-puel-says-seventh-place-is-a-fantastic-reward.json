  "description": "Leicester boss Claude Puel was a content man after his side moved up to seventh in the Premier League table following their 2-0 home victory over Watford.",
  "content": "Jamie Vardy's first-half penalty and Riyad Mahrez's strike in injury-time gave the Foxes a seemingly-comfortable win, although Puel also took time to praise the Hornets, who have won just one game in their last 11 but were competitive throughout.The three points were a perfect response for Puel as his side were Watford's last Premier League victims when they lost 2-1 at Vicarage Road in December.\"Of course [I am] satisfied because it's a fantastic reward for the players, for the squad, because they work very hard in all the training sessions and it's important to continue this way,\" Puel said.\"It was a tough game, I said before the game it would be a difficult game because it was a strong team full of quality on the pitch and we have had difficulties in the first game away against this team. We know this team, it was difficult, but it's a fantastic reward for the players.\"Leicester could have been out of sight early on with Vardy and Wilfried Ndidi both missing good chances, meaning the victory was not sealed until Mahrez made it 2-0 late on.Puel added: \"First half there was not enough quality for us with passes, the rhythm of game was not important.\"In the second half, with good play, good space, we played well. With scoring another goal, we needed to be more clinical, we had a lot of chances. Until the last goal it was difficult to play against this team, congratulations to them because it's a tough game and a difficult team to play.\"Puel wants to ensure his side maintain the same level of performance which has seen them rise up the league to seventh since he replaced Craig Shakespeare as boss last year.\"We will see the future, we play a lot of games in a short time, it was tough for my players, it is important to continue, game after game,\" said the Frenchman.\"Next week we play in the cup, for example, it's important to put right our performance and continue this good work. It's another clean sheet for the defence, which is a good thing.\""
