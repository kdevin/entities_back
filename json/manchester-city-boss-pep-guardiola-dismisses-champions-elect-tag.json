Of course, if we maintain our level, the consistency and the way we play, then OK, we have a chance. But you never know.\"If we start to go down, and lose confidence, and don't play well regularly, then we will see. Maybe that is going to happen, and I am going to shake the hand of my opponents and congratulate them for being champions.\"But it is simple - just focus on the next game. That is the best advice I can give to my players.\"City travel to Anfield to face a Liverpool side who are unbeaten in their last 13 league games.With the Reds also bolstered this month by the Â£75m signing of defender Virgil van Dijk, Guardiola believes the Merseysiders are as exciting as in their 1980s heyday.He added: \"Jurgen Klopp is a master of the counter-attack, so they're a team who can arrive in the finishing area in three or four touches.\"I think Liverpool are playing like Liverpool were in the past, with all their history.
