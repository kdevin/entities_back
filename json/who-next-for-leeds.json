  "content": "The Dane paid the price for a seven-match winless streak, which saw the Whites fall away from the Sky Bet Championship play-offs and crash out of the FA Cup at Newport.\nA search for the 11th new manager in just six years is now under way, after owner Andrea Radrizzani made his first sacking since taking over from Massimo Cellino's tumultuous reign.\nHere's a look at the leading contenders for the vacancy based on Sky Bet's manager market...\nThe former England manager has been backed as an early favourite for the job after attending Saturday's 4-1 defeat to Cardiff on Elland Road. There appears to be little further depth to the link as he was reportedly a guest of one of Christiansen's assistants, Paul Butler, who has also left the club. The 56-year-old is, however, thought to be keen to return to management, having spent a brief time with Maccabi Tel Aviv following his sacking by Derby last season.\nIn their long and arduous battle to the return to the Premier League, could Leeds turn to be man who led them up from their low point of League One football? Grayson provided the club with their greatest stability over the last decade by some distance, lasting just over three years, and has a strong affinity after starting his career at Elland Road. He is also out of work after leaving Sunderland in October, making him a natural contender.\nAnother manager with a close link to the club, Gordon Strachan spending six seasons in the heart of Leeds' midfield. Again, he is also out of work following his departure from the Scotland national team but hasn't managed at club level since his stint at Middlesbrough ended in 2010.\nThought to be popular option among both the Leeds hierarchy and fans alike, Marco Silva's sacking by Watford has perhaps given the club the chance to succeed where Everton failed in securing his services. However, it remains to be seen whether the Portuguese boss would be willing to drop down to management in the second tier, especially with promotion this season looking a big ask and the transfer window closed.\nAnother highly thought of young manager, Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom is considered to be a suitable candidate to fit into working within the club's model of operating with a director of football. However, Leeds would have a tough tussle on their hands in convincing their Yorkshire rivals to part company, especially after handing him a new contract. That deal hardly looks impenetrable though, with Sky Sports News understanding it is a 12-month rolling contract with improved terms.\nReading manager Jaap Stam follows in the betting at 14/1 and was thought to have been on their club's shortlist following Garry Monk's shock summer exit. Based on Monk's replacement, looking left-field might well be the wiser option for punters and fellow 14/1 shot Hannes Wolf, who recently left his post as Stuttgart boss, represents the most popular surprise option, having been backed in from 25/1. Fellow former Whites Robert Molenaar and Crawley boss Harry Kewell are 16/1 options, the same price as ex Swansea manager Paul Clement, while Monk is 25/1 to return or a surprise second stint.\n",
