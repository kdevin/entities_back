  "content": "A group of his friends paid to allow the groom to have VIP access to the Bees' Championship game against Bolton on Saturday as part of his stag do surprise.Unfortunately for Goff, his \"friends\" had also paid Â£130 to book him a Junior Matchday Experience at Griffin Park, which would see him take to the pitch as an official player mascot, aged 38.He then joined the nine-year-old mascots in meeting the teams and posing for his picture with Brentford's mascot Buzz Bee.To make matters worse, Brentford then put together a video compilation of his mascot 'experience' and posted it on their official Twitter account.Mr Goff replied: \"Oh my goodness. Thanks! Everyone at Brentford was absolutely superb. Hope all of the 'real' mascots had a great day in spite of the imposter.\""
