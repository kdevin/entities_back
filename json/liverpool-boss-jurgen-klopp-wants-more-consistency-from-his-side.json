  "description": "Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool need to improve their consistency despite the club's recent upturn in fortunes.",
  "content": "The Reds are unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions and victory at Swansea on Monday, live on Sky Sports Premier League, would see him record a sixth successive win for the first time since he arrived at Anfield.It will also be the club's longest unbeaten run for more than 21 years if they avoid defeat at the Liberty Stadium but Klopp insists he is not interested in statistics.\"If nobody told me how often we didn't lose, I'd have no idea about it. That's all the past and I'm not really interested,\" he said.\"You can look back on a season after the season, not during. It's not important. We feel in a good moment.\"I see the boys training every day and it looks good, that's the truth, that's why we can play like we played so far. But we have to do it again.\"As a Liverpool player you cannot perform one week and then two weeks not - we need to deliver consistently, every day and each game.\"It's only the next game and I can't imagine any easy games in the Premier League and Swansea is for sure not an easy game.\""
