  "content": "Following his arrival from Las Palmas in 2017 for £11m, Mesa has featured for the Swans on 16 occasions and Sky Sports News understands he is unhappy with the limited first-team opportunities he has received.\nMesa, who arrived at the Swansea training ground on Thursday morning ahead of training, is understood to be keen on returning to his native Spain and the Welsh club would potentially be willing to let him go as they have ample midfield options.\nAllowing the 28-year-old to leave the Liberty City stadium on loan would reduce Swansea's wage bill and could free up funds for the club as they continue in their hunt for a striker.\nCarlos Carvalhal has already seen his side have a £14m bid rejected by West Ham for Andre Ayew, with the Hammers believed to be holding out for the £20m they paid Swansea for the player in 2016.\nSwansea, who sit bottom of the Premier League three points adrift of safety, travel to League Two side Notts County in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday.\n",
