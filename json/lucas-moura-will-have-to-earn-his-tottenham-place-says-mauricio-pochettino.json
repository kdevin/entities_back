That is the fair competition. If you are in Paris Saint-Germain and Neymar arrives, if he is better than you then he plays. It's fair, he's better.\"\"If not, then they need to compete. Lucas Moura must compete with [Erik] Lamela, with Sonny [Heung-min Son], with [Christian] Eriksen.\"Moura will undergo a series of fitness tests, starting on Saturday, and will have to prove his sharpness.Pochettino is likely to pick a similar side that won so impressively against Manchester United in midweek, but there may be a difference in approach at Anfield, where Spurs have not tasted victory since May 2011.Spurs were ripped apart at Anfield last year by Liverpool's pace in attack but there have been signs this season, away to Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, that Tottenham can show a more resilient side.\"I think this season, we are more mature, no?\" Pochettino added. \"But we are a team that remember, some people complained or criticised that Tottenham don't have Plan B.\"Now we can play with possession, without possession, in counter-attack or not counter-attack, dominate the games, play with one striker, without a striker, three at the back, five at the back, four at the back.\"Please. Now to be fair you have to say Tottenham have Plan A, B, C and D, no?\"",
