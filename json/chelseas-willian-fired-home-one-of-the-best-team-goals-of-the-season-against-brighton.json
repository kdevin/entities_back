  "description": "Willian finishes off a scintillating team move as Chelsea ran riot against Brighton in the early stages. ",
  "content": "Antonio Conte's side were without a win in five games in all competitions heading into the clash on the south coast but the front three of Eden Hazard, Willian and Michy Batshuayi were in top form against the Seagulls.With Pedro and Alvaro Morata both suspended after red cards in extra-time against Norwich, Conte saw Hazard fire his side in front just three minutes in before the trio combined to superb effect three minutes later to double their advantage.The Brazil international was involved in some slick interplay with Hazard and Batshuayi, leaving the Brighton defence all at sea before expertly finishing past Mat Ryan.Hit the video at the top of the page to watch the goal."
