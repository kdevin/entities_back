  "description": "Claude Puel made light of Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani being spotted at the Emirates on Wednesday by joking he sent them there to compile scout reports.",
  "content": "The Algerian pair were in the crowd to witness Arsenal's 2-1 win over Chelsea on Wednesday night, leading to speculation that Mahrez, in particular, could be a transfer target for the north London side.\nPuel, however, laughed off the speculation, saying: \"I asked Mahrez and Slimani to watch the game between Chelsea and Arsenal to make a report. They are good scouts!\n\"There is nothing to say about Riyad or Slimani. I think it's a good thing if there's some noise about them because it shows they are good players and shows the quality of the team.\n\"The transfer window is a period with speculation. We have to manage this period with calm. At the end of January we will be happy.\"\nThe Frenchman, who has guided Leicester to seventh in the Premier League since taking over from Craig Shakespeare in October, insisted he would be happy if Leicester made no further signings in January.\nLeicester have only added Fousseni Diabate so far this month, but Puel said: \"It would be interesting to strengthen the team if we can but if it's not possible for different reasons I am happy with this squad. I will continue to develop these players. It's not a problem for me.\"\nLeicester travel to Peterborough in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, and Puel had good news regarding the fitness of two players.\nThe 56-year-old confirmed Robert Huth and Danny Simpson were both ready to return following absences with injury.\nPuel also suggested forward Diabate could make his debut following his move from French Ligue 2 side GFC Ajaccio.\n",
