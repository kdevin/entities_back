  "content": "We asked Soccer Saturday expert Matt Le Tissier to grade 20 of the most high-profile players to switch clubs last summer, giving each of them a mark out of 10 based on their performances so far.Premier League clubs spent a record £1.4bn during the summer window with varying degrees of success as the likes of Ederson and Kyle Walker have helped Manchester City to pull clear at top of the table, while some significant buys are still to establish themselves as regular starters.Le Tissier handed one player a perfect 10, but offered less glowing reviews for some other arrivals...I don't think you could have asked for anything more and he's exceeded everybody's expectations. I'd put him up there for player of the season so far with 17 goals to his name already, although he has missed a few easy chances.He hasn't had a huge amount to do but hasn't made many mistakes when he has been called upon, which requires great concentration. His distribution is one of the reasons he was bought and we have seen him start attacks with pin-point passing.I think he's done well and is a player I like. He's not been fazed by the transfer fee and has been consistent on that right-hand side.He's done pretty well, consistent and ever-present for United, doing exactly what Jose Mourinho expected from him.He's had a decent goals return, especially when you consider how few chances he's had, and I don't think many people would have expected him to be in double-figures come this stage of the season.He did have a very good start but has tailed off a bit and his tally of 17 goals in all competitions is still a decent return. He's hopefully on his way back after some over-the-top criticism.I'd probably say it has been pretty similar to Lukaku really when you consider he's had to adapt to a new league. He missed some sitters against Arsenal and does appear better scoring with his head than his feet.I think he's been one of Everton's brighter lights, although he didn't cover himself in glory when Virgil van Dijk nodded in the winner last Friday. It is probably between him and Jack Butland for England's No 1 spot at the moment and he edges it for me.He's started to turn up over the last few weeks but he was pretty non-existent at the start of the season, so the consistency concern remains.It has been tough for him in that West Ham team and, while he's chipped in a bit, more would have been expected when he signed.I don't think he's quite scored the volume of goals he should have done and I'd expect there to be more to come with room for improvement.There are times this season where I've thought he's decent, but then others where I've questioned whether he'd ever kicked a ball before, so I'm going with a slightly generous six based on the better performances.I've not been overly impressed by him. He's struggled a little bit and given the time it is taking him to adopt you might ask why Chelsea didn't give a younger player a chance.It's a difficult one because he's not really started many games. There's been a lot of substitute appearances but I think his opportunities will increase without Philippe Coutinho around.He's shown signs of improvement and there have been a few bright moments, but you would have certainly have expected more from him after the club broke their transfer record to bring him in.That has not been a successful one with the striker struggling to even force himself into the team on a regular basis. Bournemouth certainly would have expected more than three goals at this stage.He's another one who has struggled to set the league alight but he's not played a great deal. However, it is always going to be tough to adapt going into a club like Manchester United at a young age.I don't think he's been a raging success but I think he was always going to be a fill-in for Harry Kane when he needed a rest and is a slight upgrade on Vincent Jansen.It hasn't been a particularly successful stint for Joe Hart and I think it is very difficult to justify being England No 1 when you're not even West Ham's.I've just seen nothing from him that looks like he's good enough for this league, but he's a young lad and perhaps it is a crisis of confidence which he can come back from.",
