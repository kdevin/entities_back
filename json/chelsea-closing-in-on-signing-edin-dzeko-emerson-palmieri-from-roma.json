  "description": "Chelsea are moving closer to a double deal for Roma duo Edin Dzeko and Emerson Palmieri, Sky Sports News understands.",
  "content": "A deal is progressing and the two clubs are close to reaching an agreement, with Roma wanting a fee in excess of £45m for the pair.Sky in Italy report the Serie A club want £44.4m plus £8.8m in add-ons and that Chelsea have not yet accepted their conditions, and that further talks on Tuesday could prove decisive.But Blues boss Antonio Conte is keen to bring Dzeko to Stamford Bridge to add power to his forward line, and the player is equally as keen to play under the former Juventus and Italy boss.As with all deals at Stamford Bridge, however, the final decision will be made by director Marina Granovskaia.It would see a return to the Premier League for Dzeko following a successful five-year spell at Manchester City, in which he scored 72 times in 187 appearances.Meanwhile, Sky in Italy are reporting that Palmieri's representatives are happy with terms for the 23-year-old to move to Stamford Bridge and are just waiting for the clubs to give the nod.And Sky sources believe the Blues may switch their attentions to Leicester's Islam Slimani, should their interest in Dzeko fail to reap dividends."
