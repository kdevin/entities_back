  "title": "Alexis Sanchez: Manchester United signing a ready-made superstar, says Ryan Giggs",
  "description": "In the latest Super 6 Class of ’92 Diary, Ryan Giggs discusses Alexis Sanchez’s immediate impact at Manchester United, his first week as Wales manager and a crucial Salford victory.",
  "content": "Manchester United signing Alexis Sanchez is similar to Robin van Persie in the sense that they're getting a ready-made superstar and you're seeing the contribution already with Anthony Martial upping his performances.\nThat can happen when top players come in, those around them lift their levels, and there will be some difficult selection decisions for Jose Mourinho.\nHowever, Sanchez can also play on the right, as he did at Barcelona, so if Martial is flying then he may have to play in a different position, but those sort of decisions are positive for a manager to have to make.\nIt is an extra bonus that he can play in the Champions League. To have somebody like that, who won't be fazed by playing in the big games, makes the squad look really strong.\nThe defence is obviously doing really well as well, with Ashley Young back, Luke Shaw fit and Chris Smalling and Phil Jones really solid, so I don't think they need to do any more business this month.\nI think as well as every United fan I was excited to see Henrikh Mkhitaryan join the club and he looked on the outset like a United player, scoring and creating goals.\nI played with Juan Sebastian Veron, who was one of the most talented players on the planet, but sometimes it happens where it doesn't work out, maybe because of injuries or maybe being played out of position.\nMaybe it will work out for him at Arsenal and he'll set the place on fire, so I'm not sure who has got the best part of the deal, but Sanchez has scored and assisted more goals in the Premier League.\nSuper 6 predictions:\nMy first week as Wales manager has been pretty hectic, from the press conference on Monday to looking at different hotels and facilities and then trying to speak to as many of the senior players as possible.\nI've also met one young player who I am hoping to get on board. He's been playing for Wales throughout the youth teams and is one of many players with a multiple choice on who they represent, so we want as many talented players available as possible.\nThe backroom staff will pretty much stay the same in terms of the physios and the kit man but I have been speaking to other coaches to be involved.\nI want somebody with experience, preferably with international background, but most importantly that I can trust to contribute to Wales going forward.\nGareth Bale is obviously an incredibly important player to us and, given his injuries, the availability is the main thing with him. He makes a huge difference to us and everybody looks up to him on the pitch.\nHe's fit at the moment and scoring goals and we all know what he is capable of, so it is about finding that balance of getting the best out of him, but keeping him fit.\nHe's at one of the greatest clubs in the world, winning three Champions League winners medals, and playing at the top level week in week out so that is great for us. The higher level our players play at the better.\nJust like with all of the other players, I'll be looking to pass on my experience from looking after myself playing into my 40s. It is the same with the young players as I broke through at a young age and I want to use my experience to help them fulfil their potential.\nI want all the best players available for selection but you have to have a good dialogue with the clubs and the players and maintaining those relationships is going to be key.\nIt is all about being sensible and if Gareth has an important game for his club coming up such as Champions League quarter-final and is carrying a niggle then, if it means missing out on a training session, it is better being safe than risking him getting injured.\nI went to the Salford game on Saturday and we recorded a huge win, beating second-placed Harrogate to put some daylight between ourselves and the rest of the league.\nIt was a really, really good first half, with our record signing Nick Haughton playing really well, before having to hang on a bit in the second half. It is not only about putting 11 points between us but also the momentum that we've gained.\nWe'll be looking to maintain that as the big games continue, with third-placed Brackley Town away next and fourth-placed York our following away game.\n",
