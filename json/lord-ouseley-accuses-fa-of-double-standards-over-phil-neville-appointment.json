  "content": "Lord Herman Ouseley has challenged FA's explanation for its decision not to charge Neville over tweets he had sent several years earlier.\nThe FA had looked to draw a line under the matter by announcing the 41-year-old had not broken its rules, but that has failed to satisfy the Anti-discrimination group.\n\"The FA is applying a double standard here,\" Ouseley said.\n\"There are people who have been disciplined for making comments, using tweets or otherwise, for words which have been less offensive than Phil Neville used in his tweets.\n\"I think saying it hasn't met the standard for it to go forward for investigation is very questionable.\n\"The FA will find themselves with problems with any cases they have in hand currently, or any future ones, if they don't apply the same standard as they have in this case.\"\nOne tweet from January 2012 read: \"When I said morning men I thought the women would of [sic] been busy preparing breakfast/getting kids ready/making the beds-sorry women!\"\nAnother Neville wrote in 2011 appears to make light of domestic abuse.\n\"In a world where two women are killed a week because of domestic violence, talking about battering your wives and offensive things towards women is not acceptable,\" Ouseley said.\n\"I clearly don't think the people in the football authorities who are saying it doesn't meet the standard are aware of the experience of women where violence is an everyday occurrence.\n\"In football we're trying to set a standard of decency and eliminate nastiness from the game.\n\"I don't think football should be associated with comments like that particularly from people they are putting into high positions.\"\nNeville's statement on Tuesday read: \"Following comments made a number of years ago I would like to clarify that they were not and are not a true and genuine reflection of either my character or beliefs, and would like to apologise.\n\"I am fully aware of my responsibilities as the England Women's head coach and am immensely proud and honoured to have been given the role. I am now looking forward to the future and will work tirelessly to try and help bring success to the team.\"\nNeville's sister Tracey, who is England netball head coach, has defended her brother.\n",
