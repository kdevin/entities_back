In this case Pedro understood,\" Conte said.\n\"Pedro's reaction was to stand up quickly (not to appeal for a penalty).\n\"I think the player understood, at that moment, the mistake and he wanted to stand up and admit it was a mistake 'I was a bit tired',\" Conte added.\nChelsea have received five domestic yellow cards for diving this season, more than any other top-flight club.\nBut of the three issued in Wednesday's win over Norwich, Conte felt two were incorrect.\nConte was angered by the decision not to refer a challenge on Willian by Timm Klose early in the first period of extra time to the Video Assistant Referee, describing the decision of match referee Graham Scott as a \"big mistake\".\nKlose later spoke out on the incident and admitted fouling Willian.\nThe Chelsea head coach was still seething about the decision on Friday, repeating his complaints about VAR when questioned about the diving of his players.\nPedro was sent off for a second bookable offence, a foul on Wes Hoolahan, three minutes from the end of extra-time.\nAlvaro Morata followed for two bookable offences in quick succession - for simulation and for angrily contesting the decision.\nBoth players are suspended for Chelsea's Premier League trip to Brighton on Saturday.\n",
