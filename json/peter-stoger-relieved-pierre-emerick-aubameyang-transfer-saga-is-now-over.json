  "description": "Borussia Dortmund head coach Peter Stoger says he is relieved the transfer saga involving Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is finally over.",
  "content": "The 28-year-old completed his club-record move to Arsenal on deadline day, bringing to an end the speculation about his future that had persisted throughout the January transfer window.Aubameyang had been dropped for two successive Dortmund matches for his conduct during the window, with Stoger saying he was \"not so focused at the moment.\"After sanctioning Aubameyang's move, for a fee believed to be Â£60m, Dortmund signed Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi on loan until the end of the season.Asked for his thoughts now that Aubameyang has gone, Stoger said: \"I am relieved the transfer period and the discussions of the last weeks are finally over.\"I like the decisions that have been made, because you couldn't know if the trouble would continue if [Aubameyang] had stayed.\"I think we got a good replacement for him. We are now focused on the next few weeks and think everyone is on board and knows what we want to accomplish.\"Our quality is still enough to achieve our goals, even after the loss of Aubameyang. So I think it's a good thing, because it's finally quiet again.\""
