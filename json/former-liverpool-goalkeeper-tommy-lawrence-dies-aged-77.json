  "description": "Former Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence has died aged 77.",
  "content": "Lawrence, who represented Scotland at international level on three occasions, made 390 appearances during a 14-year spell at Anfield.Liverpool signed Lawrence as an apprentice in 1957, but he had to be patient in his wait for his debut which came under Bill Shankly five years later against West Brom at the Hawthorns in 1962.Lawrence experienced great success while at Anfield, helping to secure three major trophies for the club, winning two league titles (1963/64, 1965/66) and an FA Cup (1964/65).The Scot was a permanent fixture for Liverpool during the 1960s - he missed only four league matches in the six seasons between 1963 and 1969.Ray Clemence claimed the No 1 jersey at Anfield in the 1970s which led to Lawrence making the short move to Tranmere Rovers in 1971, where he claimed 80 appearances.Lawrence ended his career with non-league club Chorley, and before retiring he took up the role of a factory quality controller in Warrington."
