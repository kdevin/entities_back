But of course, it's something that's very fresh at this moment.\"What remains is that we want to have the best squad we can have.\"Hughton was full of praise for Brown and the impact he made at the Amex, revealing he was set to hand him a bigger role in the squad for the second half of the season.When asked whether Brown was gaining momentum at Brighton, he said: \"He was, he is a very popular player here. I think before he'd come here he'd had a couple of other loans and I think that adapted him well going into a new environment.\"In the second half of the season you would have seen him much more involved, he'd had a slight hamstring injury when he first came which kept him out for a few weeks.\"But, certainly I would have seen him play in more games than perhaps in that first half.\"",
