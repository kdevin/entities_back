  "description": "Hibernian have signed Florian Kamberi on loan from Swiss club Grasshopper until the end of the season. ",
  "content": "The loan, subject to international clearance, comes after the 22-year-old impressed head coach Neil Lennon when training with Hibs' first-team squad over the last two weeks.The centre-forward had a loan spell at Bundesliga 2 side Karlsruher SC last season and has represented Switzerland at youth level.\"It's a big club for me, a big opportunity and I am very excited to be here,\" Kamberi told the club's official website.\"The training ground is very impressive - I didn't have that in Switzerland - and the team is strong. They play football, they don't play the long ball all the time, and for me when I heard about Hibs I knew from the beginning it was a great opportunity for me.\"I am a physical striker, I'm not one to stay in the box. I want to go up against defenders and bring players into play.\"Lennon said: \"I am pleased to have Flo in the door.\"He is not a monster but he is a big boy and he plays well with his back to goal. He has decent mobility and links the play well from what we have seen, and we have had a good look at him.\"I have been impressed by what he's shown and he will bring a different dimension to the way we play.\""
