  "description": "Claude Puel has given a calm response to speculation linking Harry Maguire with a move to Manchester City, describing the reports as “a good thing”.",
  "content": "City are admirers of Maguire, Sky Sports News understands, but are not considering the Leicester defender as a target for the January transfer window.Maguire has impressed since joining Leicester from Hull in the summer for a fee of £17m, resulting in the 24-year-old breaking into the England squad.Pep Guardiola's side are actively pursuing a new centre-back this month, although West Brom's Jonny Evans and Real Sociedad defender Inigo Martinez are understood to be City's main targets.The Leicester boss believes that the Premier League leaders' admiration for Maguire is a compliment for the player, but insists the defender must concentrate on improving for the Foxes.\"I think it is a good thing to have some players like that with speculation in the transfer window,\" said Puel.\"This shows we have a good player. That is a good thing.\"It is a young player signed only this season for us. He has improved and he continues his hard work in the training sessions. He needs to continue this work with us.\"Puel has also declared his desire to keep hold of Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani, but admits that some players may leave in pursuit of more playing time, with Ahmed Musa among those who could be on their way out of the King Power Stadium.When asked if any of his strikers may leave this month, Puel said: \"We will see for some players if they need or want more game time.\"I think it is important to get a good balance in the squad.\"It is a question of respect and to keep them with a good attitude and with good ambition in the squad.\"Kelechi Iheanacho, who joined from City in the summer for £25m, has struggled to make an impact and has started just twice for Leicester in the Premier League but Puel is hopeful of giving the forward more action later in the season.",
