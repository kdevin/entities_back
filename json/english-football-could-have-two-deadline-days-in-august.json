  "content": "In a move designed to end disruption and allow clubs to focus on their football, Premier League clubs have agreed to close the summer transfer window before the start of the 2018-19 season.The EFL could follow the Premier League's example and bring their transfer deadline forward when they meet next month, but as things stand, and with foreign leagues' deadlines also expected to be on August 31, we are in line for two transfer deadlines next summer.So what does this all mean for the summer window? Here's all you need to know…Fifa have confirmed this will open in England on Friday, June 9.The transfer window in England will officially close on August 31, 2018, FIFA have confirmed.However, as stated earlier, Premier League clubs voted to close their own window at 5pm on Thursday August 9, two days before the first match of the 2018/19 season.All of which means top-flight clubs will have an official trading window between June 9 and August 9 this summer.It came after a number of Premier League managers and club officials complained about the negative impact of transfer uncertainty and speculation on their players.Last summer, Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa, Philippe Coutinho and Virgil van Dijk were just four of a list of players who did not play for their clubs as they pursued exits.Sky sources understand the decision was not unanimous between the Premier League clubs. It was reached instead by 14 clubs, a two-thirds majority.Five clubs voted against the change and one abstained.Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore told Sky Sports News...\"There was a big concern that the Premier League has been playing two or three match rounds with a degree of uncertainty between themselves.\"It wasn't unanimous but nobody was pathologically angry about the situation. But there were some concerns by some clubs that, although they wouldn't be able to buy any more players, their players could still be picked off by those who haven't closed their windows. It just meant they couldn't support it.\"We did have managers' meetings before the season started. The managers are very strong on it. Almost all of them were in favour of shutting it earlier. The clubs just think it's wrong that, going into the first game of the season, they could be playing against a player that, a few weeks later, could be playing for a different club.\"Bringing the deadline forward will eradicate panic buys after two or three games of the season, but it will also give Premier League clubs significantly less time to complete their business.Next summer, the window will close less than four weeks after the end of the World Cup. Factor in players taking holidays after the Russia showpiece, and Premier League clubs will be left rushing to complete their business in a much shorter time-frame.The heightened pressure and urgency could make Deadline Day even more frantic for Premier League clubs.As things stand, the transfer window for the English Football League remains unaffected, with EFL clubs allowed to buy from Premier League clubs.However, EFL clubs will vote later this month over whether to change their summer window in line with the Premier League for incoming transfers.EFL clubs will also vote on the registration of players on a temporary loan transfer until the end of August.The EFL is understood to favour keeping loan deals until the end of the month, with just under a quarter of all loans completed on Deadline Day in August.Following an early closure, if clubs agree, it is understood the league would only allow clubs to convert a standard loan to a permanent transfer the following January, to prevent any misuse of its proposed new rule.The transfer windows in Spain, France, Germany and Italy all expected to open in early June.As usual, the deadlines are expected to fall on August 31, with Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and La Liga showing no signs of following the Premier League's lead.Premier League clubs will no longer be able to make signings when the season gets underway, but the change does not apply to other leagues, meaning Premier League players will still be able to move abroad - and at the moment to EFL clubs - up until August 31.That means transfer sagas such as Barcelona's pursuit of Coutinho last summer could still drag on into the season, creating the same kind of unwanted distractions for Premier League bosses.However, Premier League clubs will be in a position to charge a premium from foreign clubs after the early deadline has passed, but they will be unable to reinvest their earnings until the January window.",
