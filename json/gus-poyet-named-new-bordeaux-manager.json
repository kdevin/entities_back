  "content": "Former Chelsea and Tottenham midfielder Poyet left his previous managerial position with Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenua in September.\nThe Uruguayan resigned following a string of consecutive defeats, but has now re-entered management with the Ligue 1 club.\nGourvennec was sacked by Bordeaux last week after winning just two games from the previous 13, with Eric Bedouet placed in temporary charge.\nThe French club announced Poyet's appointment on Saturday via their official website and social media, confirming Mauricio Taricco would be installed as his second in command.\nBordeaux currently find themselves in 11th place in Ligue 1.\nOne of Poyet's first tasks looks to be keeping hold of Brazilian winger Malcom, who is wanted by a series of Premier League clubs.\nNorth London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham have been linked with the player, though a January transfer appears unlikely at present.\n",
