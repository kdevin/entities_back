  "description": "Rangers defender Bruno Alves could be set for another lengthy lay-off after posting a photo of himself in a leg brace.",
  "content": "Alves lasted less than 20 minutes of Saturday's goalless draw at Celtic Park before limping off and he left Parkhead on crutches with Gers boss Graeme Murty revealing the pain was coming either from his ankle or calf.The 36-year-old Portugal defender was still on crutches wearing a protective boot on his left leg as he praised the \"quality service\" from Hospital Senhor Do Bonfim in his homeland on his Instagram account on Tuesday.The former Porto centre-back has had two previous lay-offs this season, both lasting about a month, following calf and back problems.Rangers fly out to Florida at the weekend ahead of a tournament where they will face Brazilian sides Atletico Mineiro and Corinthians, with their next competitive game coming against Fraserburgh in the William Hill Scottish Cup on January 21."
