Yes [he will play].\"I have always been positive about Simon Mignolet. It is a very difficult job to be a goalkeeper or centre-half at Liverpool because nobody forgives one mistake.\"If our goalkeeper makes a mistake then it is a disaster and if any other goalkeeper makes a mistake, then he is a fantastic goalkeeper and we should buy him.\"I am really fine with our goalkeeper situation. Yes, Karius could have made a save for the first goal against Manchester City, but he is a really good goalkeeper.\"We brought him in because we wanted him to play. He has settled, there are a lot of really good things in his game. We have changed a lot of positions throughout the season. I changed not my opinion but the situation - that is all.\"Of course Loris has to deliver, he knows that, but he is the No 1. \"",
