  "description": "Chelsea prepare to face Brighton on Saturday, live on Sky Sports, having only scored once in their last four games. So what's behind their struggles in front of goal?",
  "content": "Antonio Conte's side have scored seven goals fewer than they had at the same stage of last season, and tactics expert Danny Higginbotham believes it is down to their change in system.The former Stoke and Manchester United defender explains how the departure of Nemanja Matic has compromised Chelsea's attacking play.Matic and N'Golo Kante \"did the job of three players\" last season, according to Higginbotham, but Conte has had to sacrifice an attacker in the wake of Matic's departure, with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Cesc Fabregas playing either side of Kante and Eden Hazard moving behind Alvaro Morata.It makes Chelsea easier to defend against, says Higginbotham, with wing-backs Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso no longer finding as much space in wide areas as they did last season.Watch the video above to see Higginbotham's full analysis and tune in to Sky Sports Premier League HD from 11.30am on Saturday for live coverage of Brighton v Chelsea."
