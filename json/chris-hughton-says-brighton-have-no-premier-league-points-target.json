We have our targets every single week which is to try and get as many points as we can in that next game.\"The obvious 40-point target is because of history and averages, it's not a bad one to cling on to. I must admit I have no idea what it will take this season.\"Brighton, who have not won in the Premier League since December 23, host West Ham on Saturday with David Moyes' side three points better off in the table.\"What I do know is that we have a huge amount of competition this end of the table\" Hughton added. \"Whoever is playing each other at this end of the table, it's obviously a bigger game.\"There's no targets.
