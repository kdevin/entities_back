  "description": "It proved to be a frustrating night for Liverpool at the Liberty Stadium with Alfie Mawson's strike handing Swansea victory, but Jurgen Klopp's almost snatched a dramatic, late equaliser.",
  "content": "Virgil van Dijk's inch-perfect cross picked out Roberto Firmino deep into stoppage time at the far post, but the Brazilian's header came crashing back off the post.The danger was not over there for Swansea as the ball dropped to Adam Lallana on the edge of the six-yard box, but Mawson proved to be the match-winner at both ends with a brilliant block to deny the England international.The hosts held on for only their fifth league win of the season to reduce the gap between them and safety to three points.Earlier in the game, Mawson pounced on a poor Van Dijk clearance from a corner to score a 40th-minute winner.Watch the late drama at the Liberty Stadium by hitting play on the video at the top of the page..."
