  "content": "Former Chelsea and West Ham forward Cole currently plays for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, but has dipped his toe into the pundit pool recently with Sky Sports.He has also been completing his coaching badges, and discussed the pros and cons of both options as well as which one he would prefer to do as a career when he retires.\"It's hard, you've got to find where you're most comfortable and happy,\" he said on Soccer AM. \"I'm in a position where I want to give back to football one day, so coaching is partly the plan.\"I don't know [if I want to be a manager]. I won't say I'll definitely do it, and put pressure on myself, but I'd like to be involved whether as a No 1 or No 2, or I might try that, not like it and try to make it as a career as a pundit.\"I've been working with England U18s, just going in a few times and watching and learning. At this stage it is getting experience, seeing how they do it. I've been coaching a bit over in Tampa, I'm nearly through my A licence.\"Hit play on the video above to see what he had to say."
