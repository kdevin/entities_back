  "description": "Carlos Carvalhal says he would like to sign \"lobsters\" in January but admits Swansea may only have enough money for \"sardines\".",
  "content": "The Swansea boss has started looking for new recruits having taken over at the Liberty Stadium in December following the dismissal of Paul Clement.However, Carvalhal says he may have to accept not signing his primary targets.\"Probably we have money for sardines and I am thinking lobster,\" he said.\"I will do my best to try to bring in the best players. That is why I am starting to look to the lobsters and to the sea bass, if not we must try sardines.\"Sometimes sardines can win games!\"We can jump to another level sometimes. It is not a question of money, sometimes it's a question of opportunity and the quality of the players.\"So having just taken up the position, and only until the end of the season, does Carvalhal expect to be choosing his own catch this month?\"I do this all the time if I see a gap in the squad, everybody knows that. Of course I have players in my mind, I propose the players that are in my mind.\"Swansea have won one and lost one since Carvalhal took charge, and they remain bottom of the Premier League after Tuesday's 2-0 defeat at home to Tottenham.Carvalhal accepts it could be difficult attracting top-quality players in the club's current predicament.\"It is not an easy situation for us at the moment about the money and about the market and about the situation we have in the competition,\" he said.\"Not all the players want to come to a team that is fighting like us to stay in the competition.\"He added: \"I never deal with my money. I am a conservative, I am romantic of football and romantics don't' care too much about money.\"I look to the players, if I like a player I tell the chairman but don't ask me about money because it is not my job.\"Carvalhal's immediate concern is Saturday's trip to Wolves in the the FA Cup third round - the bottom club in the Premier League taking on the top side in the Championship.",
