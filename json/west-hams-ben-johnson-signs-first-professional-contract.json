It's been a long time coming, but I've worked hard and I feel it's fully deserved. I'm feeling good,\" Johnson told the club's official website.\"I've always dreamt of being a footballer. I think I just wanted to put my head down and enjoy my football - take it season by season, which I am doing, and I think I've reaped the rewards this season especially.\"Towards the end of last season, I had an injury and I was out for quite a long time. I felt I just needed to come back with a bang and I just did - came back, worked hard, put my head down fully focused and just had a good season. I need to kick on now.\""
