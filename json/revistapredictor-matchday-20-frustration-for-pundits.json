  "description": "David Garrido looks back at the #RevistaPredictor on LaLiga Matchday 20 - when the pundits were frustrated by a tricky trio of games which avoided many of the big names...",
  "content": "Just when we thought we'd found the Predictor's Achilles heel, we have another week of frustration.\nMATCH 1 - ESPANYOL 0-3 SEVILLA\nThis was the match which elicited the most varied predictions, with all three match outcomes covered, but in the end it was only Rob Palmer who got that bit right, saying Sevilla would leave Catalunya with the points. But this was a much improved performance from Vincenzo Montella's side, who needed a decent result after bad defeats against Real Sociedad, Real Betis and Alaves, and it looks like he is given up playing square pegs in round holes, which is a start. Espanyol simply did not have the intensity and application of their midweek Copa del Rey win over Barcelona, and they looked leggy as a result. It could also have been a hangover from the speculation surrounding Quique Sanchez Flores who was offered the Stoke City job. It's the end of Espanyol's unbeaten run in LaLiga which has taken them away from the relegation zone, but they are not clear of danger yet.\nMATCH 2 - VILLARREAL 2-1 LEVANTE\nFor four of us, we were minutes away from a correct 2-0 scoreline in this game which would have earned us four points... but then Roger Martí, making his first appearance of the season after recovering from a knee ligament injury, came off the bench to score a late penalty to give Levante a consolation. Frustrating for us (just a point apiece instead), but it's even worse for Levante who have scored just two goals in their last eight La Liga games and they have only won once since the mid-late September. Roger's return could help their search for goals and it could not be more timely... Levante sit 17th, just two points above the relegation zone. As for Villarreal, they have put together a useful unbeaten run of five league games, four of them victories, and they are very much in the race for fourth along with Real Madrid and Sevilla. And of course they have got 40m Euros to spend from the Cedric Bakambu sale.\nMATCH 3 - ALAVES 2-2 LEGANES\nYou've got to feel for David Phillips here. With 75 minutes played, he was sitting on a perfect 10 points for 2-0 Alaves and Munir as first goalscorer... only for Alaves to surprisingly capitulate at Mendizorrotza and share the points. It meant the rest of us picked up a point for the draw, and a useful result for Leganes to not only keep themselves relatively safely ensconced in mid-table, but also to check Alaves' momentum. They had won their previous five games at home in all competitions, and had not conceded in Vitoria for 471 minutes before kick-off. John Guidetti was actually involved in both goals for the home side - he could be a shrewd piece of business, joining from Celta Vigo and in search of regular first-team football to seal his place in Sweden's World Cup squad. For Lega, they were lucky with their penalty for 2-1, but they will take that in their battle for survival.\nKevin Keatings is fast becoming the Barcelona of our pundits' league on the #RevistaPredictor... he is way ahead, doing well enough but not exactly setting the world alight, and the rest of us are just not good enough to catch up. Something has to change, otherwise this is only a one-horse race.\nAs for your predictions on Twitter, some notable mentions - 11 points for @WezTucker for picking Munir as first goalscorer and the draw at Alaves, plus he got the score bang on at the Estadio de la Cerámica. Otherwise, @SamLeveridge picked up nine points, @steven_c00k and @Campbell6_@ got 8, and @jackie_boyjw seven points. Well done, one and all - and don't forget to check @SkyRevista on Twitter on Friday for the next round of chosen games on the #RevistaPredictor.\n",
