  "description": "Ross Barkley made his Chelsea debut on Wednesday but was unable to prevent them losing their Carabao Cup semi-final to Arsenal 2-1 on aggregate. ",
  "content": "The £15m January signing from Everton stepped off the bench to replace the injured Willian on the half hour mark.Here, we detail how he got on and see what his manager Antonio Conte had to say about his performance…Antonio Conte: \"He has a lot of space for improvement. He's working with us, he's only been here two weeks. But for sure, today I was forced to make this substitution. At the same time, I think he can improve a lot.\"After a long-term hamstring injury, this was Barkley's first appearance of the season and there was clearly some ring rust on show. Barkley struggled to influence the game - although he was not the only Chelsea attacking midfielder to fail to make a major impact on Wednesday night.There were a couple of flashes of his potential - some neat footwork in the centre circle and a driving run past Nacho Monreal the highlights - but Conte will hope to draw much more out of the England international as he builds up his match fitness."
