  "content": "Thorne has returned from a broken leg which cost him all of last season to make 16 appearances in 2017-18 so far, more recently forcing his way into the starting XI.His previous deal was due to expire in the summer and he joins goalkeeper Scott Carson in committing his long-term future to the Pride Park club.Thorne told the club's official website: \"I'm delighted to get the deal done and to be at Derby County for the next few years.\"It's nice to have it all sorted off the back of the injury that I had last season; it was a difficult period for me but I feel this is a reward for the hard work it took to get back to this stage.\"I feel that the club has put faith in me and I really want to repay that. I said when I signed a few years ago that I wanted to help take this club back to the Premier League and that's very much my ambition.\"We've got a great set of lads here and we're all really enjoying our football. It's great to be having that winning feeling and hopefully we can have a strong push between now and the end of the season.\"",
