  "content": "Mbemba moved to Newcastle from Anderlecht for £8m in 2015 but has had limited opportunities to play this season.\nWest Ham are keen to sign a central defender this month, with Swansea's Alfie Mawson their top target, but the Welsh club are reluctant to sell the England U21.\nNewcastle would want to make sure they have a replacement before sanctioning the sale of Mbemba.\nAnd West Ham would be happy to include Diafra Sakho, who is in talks over a £10m move to Crystal Palace, as part of any potential deal.\nThere are now doubts over whether Palace's deal for striker Sakho, who has struggled for first-team games at the Hammers, will be completed.\nWhatever happens, Sky Sports News has been told that Sakho will definitely be leaving West Ham this month.\n",
