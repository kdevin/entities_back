  "description": "West Ham have been offered the chance to sign Newcastle centre-back Chancel Mbemba, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "Mbemba moved to Newcastle from Anderlecht for £8m in 2015 but has had limited opportunities to play this season.West Ham are keen to sign a central defender this month, with Swansea's Alfie Mawson their top target, but the Welsh club are reluctant to sell the England U21.Newcastle would want to make sure they have a replacement before sanctioning the sale of Mbemba.And West Ham would be happy to include Diafra Sakho, who is in talks over a £10m move to Crystal Palace, as part of any potential deal.There are now doubts over whether Palace's deal for striker Sakho, who has struggled for first-team games at the Hammers, will be completed.Whatever happens, Sky Sports News has been told that Sakho will definitely be leaving West Ham this month.",
