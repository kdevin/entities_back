  "content": "Flores was asked about whether he had an offer to return to the Premier League after his Espanyol side reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey.\nEspanyol overturned a first-leg deficit against Levante to progress to the competition's last eight.\nFlores said: \"I'm not going to talk about me on such an important day for Espanyol. It's a day for Espanyol, for the club, for the players, it's a day to celebrate for having qualified for the quarters.\n\"I don't want to talk about me, but to enjoy these moments. I want to continue being happy with my profession.\"\nSky Sports' Spanish football expert Guillem Balague revealed on Thursday that Stoke set the former Watford boss a Friday deadline to decide whether he will return to England.\nBalague said a five-year proposal from Stoke would tempt Flores after a tenure of broken promises at Espanyol.\nThe 52-year-old alluded to that in his post-match press conference but did not indicate he wanted to leave the club.\nHe added: \"I'm very grateful to Espanyol, I've been frustrated sometimes because we haven't advanced as fast as desired, but that's because Espanyol haven't been able to, not because they haven't wanted to.\n\"Right now we're not thinking about anything other than today's game and Sunday's match against Athletic [Bilbao].\"\nIt is also understood that Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill is under consideration for the manager's job at the bet365 Stadium.\nO'Neill and his coaching team, which features Roy Keane, agreed contract extensions with the Football Association of Ireland last October.\nBut the 65-year-old said after the Republic lost their World Cup qualifying play-off the following month that he would need to have \"a real think\" about his future, and still nothing has been signed.\n",
