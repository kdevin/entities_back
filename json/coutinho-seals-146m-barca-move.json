But one of the important aspects was that he [Coutinho] wanted to come here. He made an effort, he was patient and that was a determining factor in bringing him here.\n\"Everybody knows him as a player, we know about his professional career, but what I can say is that it wasn't easy to bring him here. He wanted to be here and he's part of this new project with [Ernesto] Valverde.\n\"I want to thank Liverpool, one of Europe's biggest clubs, for allowing him to leave.\"\nCoutinho has already played for Liverpool in this season's Champions League, and will therefore be ineligible to play for Barcelona in the competition during the current campaign.\nLiverpool, meanwhile, will not be able to move Naby Keita's transfer from RB Leipzig forward, according to Sky in Germany.\nThe transfer has already been agreed for the summer at 75m euros (£66.4m) but the club are not willing to let him go in January, even for an improved fee.\n",
