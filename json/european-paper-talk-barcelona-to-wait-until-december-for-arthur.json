(Sport)\nCristiano Ronaldo's attitude after being substituted in Real Madrid's 2-2 draw at Levante has upset several of his team-mates who felt his actions showed a lack of respect towards them. (Sport)\nClarence Seedorf is set to replace the sacked Cristobal Parralo as Deportivo La Coruna manager, with the La Liga strugglers currently sitting in 18th. The Dutchman is the third-choice candidate, with moves for Martin Lasarte and Diego Alonso collapsing.

I want to stay because both me and my family like it here,\" he said. (Superdeporte)\nRB Leipzig head coach Ralph Hasenhuttl says Ademola Lookman could have been taken off before his debut goal for his new side. The Austrian said: \"He was lucky that he was still on the pitch for the goal. I really wanted to take him out because he'd just slipped again.\n\"That was the same in practice on Friday.

(Bild)\nInter have agreed terms with Racing Club striker Lautaro Martinez and are close to sealing a €23m (£20.2m) deal to see him join them in the summer. The 20-year-old has been subject of Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid transfer rumours, but has agreed terms with the Italian side on a three-year contract, with the option of a fourth.

(Corriere dello Sport)\nBenfica transfer target Tyronne Ebuehi decided to stay at ADO Den Haag in the January transfer window to maximise his game time to get into the Nigeria squad ahead of the World Cup this summer. He is still expected to join the Portuguese giants when the season is over though. (O Jogo)\n",
