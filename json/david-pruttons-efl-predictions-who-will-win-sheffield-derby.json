  "content": "But who is our resident expert tipping for victory? Read on to find out...\nFulham are well and truly flying at the moment. Just like last season they had a slow start to the campaign and now they're right in the mix for the play-offs.\nA victory at Barnsley, who have not won at home since November, would send Slavisa Jokanovic's side into the top six. The Tykes haven't been on a great run themselves and it's hard to see them getting a result here. Away win for me.\nPrutton predicts: 0-2 (9/1 with Sky Bet)\nBrentford are another side to have forced themselves into the play-off equation after a fantastic run of recent form. It's an absolute scrap for those positions and if they can keep it up then they'll be a real contender come the end of the season.\nNorwich, meanwhile, suffered a real blow when they lost at home to Sheffield United last week. A win here would give them a glimmer of hope again of reaching the top six, but I think this is a Brentford victory.\nPrutton predicts: 2-0 (9/1 with Sky Bet)\nBristol City have to concentrate on the league again now their fantastic Carabao Cup run has come to an end. Once again they put in an excellent shift against Manchester City in midweek, but now it's back to the reality of the Championship.\nIan Holloway's side will have a go as they always do, but I fancy the Robins to get back to winning ways against QPR, although it won't be easy.\nPrutton predicts: 1-0 (13/2 with Sky Bet)\nOne point from their last two games actually represents a bit of a slump as far as Wolves are concerned! That defeat at home to Nottingham Forest last week would have been a real wake-up call for Nuno's side that the job isn't done yet.\nIpswich may smell a bit of blood here and might fancy their chances at Portman Road, and Mick McCarthy's side can cause anyone problems on their day. I reckon this will be a draw.\nPrutton predicts: 1-1 (11/2 with Sky Bet)\nThey have huffed and they've puffed but Blackburn have finally hauled themselves into the top two in Sky Bet League One, and you would think that Tony Mowbray's side would go on to win automatic promotion from here.\nTheir respective league positions would suggest this is a home banker, but Northampton have finally turned a corner under Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and three wins on the spin have seen them clamber out of the relegation zone. That being said, I think Rovers will edge this one.\nPrutton predicts: 2-1 (7/1 with Sky Bet)\nWhat a fantastic win that was for Crawley at Notts County in midweek, although the three points were nicked in very bizarre circumstances at the end! Harry Kewell has got his side charging up the table now, and is repaying the faith the club showed in him after a tricky start to the season.\nAccrington, meanwhile, are back in the automatic promotion positions after four wins on the spin and will have their sights set on staying there. I'm backing a home win on Saturday though.\nPrutton predicts: 3-1 (28/1 with Sky Bet)\n",
