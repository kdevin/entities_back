This means that what arrived [bids] was not good.\"Chelsea have reportedly targeted several strikers in the January transfer window, including Andy Carroll and Ashley Barnes, as Antonio Conte searches for a target man to ease the burden on Alvaro Morata.Dzeko was named in the starting line-up for Roma's trip to Sampdoria on Wednesday night."
