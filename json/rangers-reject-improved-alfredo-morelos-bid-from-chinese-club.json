  "content": "On Tuesday, Sky Sports News reported how the Chinese club had offered £7m upfront for the striker.Gers boss Graeme Murty previously confirmed there was interest in the Colombian forward from a Chinese Super League club, but that no side had met the Glasgow club's valuation of the 21-year-old.Morelos has scored 13 times for Rangers since his £1.5m transfer from HJK Helsinki last summer, and is the club's top scorer this season.We understand the striker is not one of Rangers' best paid players and is keen to discuss a move to the Chinese club.The Ibrox club are not keen to sell Morelos without a replacement lined up, with Murty saying on Tuesday: \"We have to make sure we're making good, footballing decisions. Taking Alfredo out of our squad without a ready-made replacement to strengthen us is not a decision I'm prepared to make.\""
