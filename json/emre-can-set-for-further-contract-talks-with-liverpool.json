  "description": "Emre Can is set to hold further talks with Liverpool this month regarding his future, Sky sources understand.",
  "content": "Can's current deal is set to expire in six months, allowing him to leave Merseyside on a free deal.Speculation has mounted over a potential move away, with the player able to sign a pre-contract agreement this month with a club outside of the Premier League.The Germany international reached an impasse with the Reds during the previous set of negotiations, with the stumbling block believed to be Liverpool's reluctance to break their club precedent and insert a buy-out clause into any new deal.Juventus have been heavily linked with the 24-year-old and have made their interest in a possible deal known.As recently reported by Sky Sports, Can revealed he does not have any existing agreement in place with the Italian side ahead of a summer switch.The player's representatives will again sit down with Liverpool to discuss the option of continuing Can's stay with Jurgen Klopp's side.Can's development since his Â£9.75m move to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen in 2014 saw him grow in stature on the international scene and become a regular in the Germany set-up.Speaking recently of his future, Can outlined his dedication to Liverpool while maintaining he was still in talks with several parties.\"My agent is looking after everything but I am here until the summer. I haven't signed anything (with Juventus) or anyone,\" said Can.\"I am talking with everyone, of course I am talking with Liverpool. Why not? I still have a contract here. It is an amazing club. What can I say? My agent does the rest.\"I just concentrate on my performance and the football. I will give everything for this team,\" the German added."
