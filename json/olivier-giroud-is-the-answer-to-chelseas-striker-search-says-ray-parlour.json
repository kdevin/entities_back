  "description": "Olivier Giroud would be a \"perfect\" signing for Chelsea as they look for a back-up to Alvaro Morata, according to Ray Parlour.",
  "content": "The Premier League champions have showed interest in West Ham striker Andy Carroll this month, and there have also been reports that they have made enquiries about Stoke's Peter Crouch.\nWhile Sky sources understand Stoke are not aware of any interest, it appears Chelsea are on the hunt for a striker.\nAnd former Arsenal midfielder Parlour said Giroud, who has started only one Premier League game this season, would be an ideal fit.\n\"He would be perfect,\" said Parlour. \"Whether Arsenal would want to lose another of their players to a rival is another matter.\n\"But I am sure if Chelsea put a decent bid in he would be tempted because he hasn't got to move, he can live in London, a bit like Petr Cech. He was settled in London and wanted to stay there.\"\nPaul Merson agreed with his former Arsenal team-mate, saying: \"It's staring Chelsea straight in the eye. They were looking at Carroll, now they are talking about Crouch - Giroud is the answer.\n\"If they are looking for someone who is big and strong and can come on and change a game I don't see anybody better. Giroud is very underrated.\"\n",
