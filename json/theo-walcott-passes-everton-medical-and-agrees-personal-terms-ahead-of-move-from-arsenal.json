  "description": "Theo Walcott has passed a medical and agreed personal terms with Everton ahead of his proposed move from Arsenal.",
  "content": "Walcott was seen entering Everton's training ground, Finch Farm, on Tuesday afternoon, and has completed and passed a medical ahead of his transfer.Sky Sports News understands the fee for the winger is in the region of £20m with just the final details of the deal left to be finalised.Last week, Everton boss Sam Allardyce confirmed the Toffees had entered into negotiations with Arsenal over the sale of Walcott, who has been with the Gunners since joining from Southampton in 2006.The Saints had also been keen to land the England international but it appears Everton have now won the race for the 28-year-old's signature.Sky Sports News understands that the Merseyside club's spending power and Walcott's desire to work with Allardyce are the key reasons for his decision to head to the north-west.Everton have already signed Turkey international Cenk Tosun from Besiktas for £27m earlier this month and Allardyce believes Walcott would be another \"great addition\" to his squad."
