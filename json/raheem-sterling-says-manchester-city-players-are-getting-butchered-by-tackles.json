  "content": "West Brom winger Matt Phillips was booked for a wild tackle on midfielder Brahim Diaz in City's 3-0 league win in midweek and it followed a caution for winger James McClean after his lunge on City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne.\nLeroy Sane has been ruled out for at least six weeks with ankle ligament damage suffered in City's 2-0 win at Cardiff City in the FA Cup fourth round last month following a challenge from Joe Bennett.\n\"Some of the players are getting butchered out there and it's sad to see,\" Sterling said.\n\"There are going to be challenges that are badly timed and probably not all of them are intentional, but if it's a dangerous tackle it's a dangerous tackle and the referees and officials need to cut these tackles out.\n\"I find it unfair at times. We haven't been protected enough in certain situations.\"\nSterling said that potential injuries resulting from poor challenges could lead to players missing the World Cup in Russia later this year.\n\"The majority of the players in the top flight and in our team will be playing in it and it would be sad to see someone miss the tournament due to a silly tackle,\" he added.\nCity are 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League going into Saturday's game against Burnley at Turf Moor, live on Sky Sports.\n",
