When I met Michael, first of all when I starting coaching him at Coventry, he always asked questions, was always willing to take information, but at the end of the day he was his own man,\" Strachan told TalkSport.\"There was a lot to be thinking about, a lot to be done - he lives in Scotland and he could have been swayed - but he has had a look at it and for whatever reason, I don't know, he has decided to stay with a group of people that he has worked very well with for the last five years.\"Sometimes you get so long to think, there is so many things come into your thinking and you think well, it seems like a good idea at a time, but the longer you have to think of it you think maybe it is not such a good idea.\"O'Neill now appears poised to sign an improved contract, the Irish Football Association having offered him a deal which runs until 2024.Meanwhile, Scotland will continue their search for the man who they hope can end a long wait for major tournament qualification, which extends to the 1998 World Cup.",
