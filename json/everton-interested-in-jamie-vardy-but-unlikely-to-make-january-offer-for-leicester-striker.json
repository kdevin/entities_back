  "content": "Sam Allardyce is a long-time admirer of Vardy and he would be very keen to add him to his squad, Sky Sports News has been informed.But Everton have already spent almost £50m on Theo Walcott and Cenk Tosun in January, and Allardyce indicated in his news conference earlier on Friday that there are unlikely to be any further incomings.The club are also thought to have concerns about paying a hefty transfer fee for a player who turned 31 last week.Leicester would resist any attempt to lure Vardy away, with Arsenal seeing a bid of around £20m fail 18 months ago, even though they had matched his release clause.The England striker chose instead to stay at Leicester and signed a new contract - believed to have no release clause - later that summer.Leicester boss Claude Puel said last week he has too many strikers at the club, and he will listen to offers for some, but Sky Sports News understands that does not include Vardy and Shinji Okazaki.",
