  "content": "Hugill has scored 10 goals in 29 appearances this season for Alex Neil's side and could make his Premier League debut against Brighton on Saturday.\nHis form in the Sky Bet Championship attracted the attention of a number Premier League clubs, including Crystal Palace, but Hugill will wear the No 12 shirt at the London Stadium.\n\"I'm absolutely delighted!\" Hugill told West Ham's official club website. \"It's been a long day, but to get this over the line is amazing for me and it's now a new challenge for me and hopefully I can bring what I did at Preston here and show what I can do.\n\"It's amazing to know I'm a Premier League footballer, to know where I've come from in the last five years to where I am now in the Premier League is amazing.\n\"I'm still pinching myself to see if it's all real, but hopefully I can bring my qualities from Preston here to West Ham. Without a doubt it's a huge opportunity and I'm looking forward to it.\"\n",
