  "description": "An outrageous piece of skill from Marseille playmaker Dimitri Payet saw Strasbourg's goalkeeper stretchered off in Ligue 1 on Tuesday night.",
  "content": "The France international, who moved to the south of France from West Ham United this time last year, scored his side's second goal late on in a 2-0 win over Strasbourg at the Stade Velodrome to keep up the pressure on runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the table.And it was a moment to remember from the eye-catching 30-year-old, who latched on to substitute Clinton Njie's defence-splitting pass, before racing through on goal to face the visiting 'keeper.Payet's quick brain, and feet, saw him dummy the onrushing Alexandre Oukidja, who was left in a heap on the turf as a result, while the player then rolled the ball into the empty net.Oukidja, however, was unable to continue, being replaced by back-up Kossi Agassa for the final minute of the game.Watch the above video to see Payet's breathtaking goal",
