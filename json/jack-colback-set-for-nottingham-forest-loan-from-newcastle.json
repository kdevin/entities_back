  "content": "Colback has fallen out of favour at St James' Park and has not made a single appearance in the Premier League this season.The midfielder featured heavily in the last campaign as the Magpies earned promotion from the Championship, but has fallen behind Jonjo Shelvey, Isaac Hayden and Mikel Merino in the pecking order.Colback joined Newcastle from local rivals Sunderland on a free transfer in 2014 on a five-year deal.The 28-year-old has made 179 top-flight appearances, scoring nine goals and providing 10 assists.Colback would become the fifth player to agree a loan exit from Newcastle on Deadline Day, following the departures of Henri Saivet, Rolando Aarons, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Freddie Woodman.Forest have also signed Sporting Lisbon defender Tobias Figueiredo on loan until the end of the season.Figueiredo, who has Champions League and Europa League experience from his time in Portugal, became the first signing of Aitor Karanka's tenure.",
