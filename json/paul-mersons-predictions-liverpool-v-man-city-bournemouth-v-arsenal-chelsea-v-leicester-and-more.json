  "description": "Paul Merson is back with another round of his Premier League predictions - how will he fare this week?",
  "content": "Merse is back refreshed after a fortnight in the Florida sun, ready to offer his take on a bumper line-up of top-flight action.But who is the Magic Man tipping to win? Read on to find out...Arsenal weren't free flowing at Chelsea by any means but it was a good result for the first leg of a semi-final, there's no doubt about that. Bournemouth will take the game to Arsenal and I fancy them to get a result. I just don't think Arsenal are that good at the moment. They struggled at the Vitality last season and I think Bournemouth will go after them again.PAUL PREDICTS: 2-1 (12/1 with Sky Bet)I think Liverpool could be the team that finally beat Manchester City. I know Philippe Coutinho is not there anymore but they've still got the firepower to beat them, with Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. City haven't won at Anfield since 2003, although you've got to remember what City were like back then, they're not the team they are now that's for sure. But I fancy Liverpool - I didn't think I'd ever say that!PAUL PREDICTS: 2-1 (10/1 with Sky Bet)With Stoke yet to appoint a successor to Mark Hughes, I fear for them at Old Trafford. They're in disarray and to get beaten at Coventry in the FA Cup was unbelievable, no disrespect to Coventry. They're in major trouble and I see a routine win for United to maintain their top-four challenge.PAUL PREDICTS: 2-0 (5/1 with Sky Bet)Before I watched the Carabao Cup semi-final with Arsenal I would have said Chelsea would win this 3-0, but I'm not so sure now. They struggled in what was a poor game.Having said that, I think Chelsea will have too much for a Leicester side whose form has been up and down. They lost to Watford, who have won once in a blue moon, and with Chelsea needing a win to consolidate their position in the top four, I fear for the Foxes.PAUL PREDICTS: 2-0 (11/2 with Sky Bet)There are some big games this weekend start with this one at Selhurst Park. Burnley have been great this season; getting a draw at Man Utd, winning at Chelsea. But I'm going to go for Palace here. This is a really tough one to predict though, it wouldn't surprise me if Burnley won, but I fancy Palace to just edge it.PAUL PREDICTS: 2-1 (8/1 with Sky Bet)Another six-pointer! West Ham are another inconsistent side, having held Tottenham before never looking like scoring at Shrewsbury in the FA Cup - they wouldn't have scored if they were still playing now!The Terriers are strong at home, though, and I'm not sure whether West Ham will be able to cope with their pressing game. With that in mind, I fancy David Wagner's men to get another huge three points for their survival bid.PAUL PREDICTS: 2-1 (9/1 with Sky Bet)Again, this is another game that's hard to call. Swansea were great at Watford and unfortunate at home to Spurs in the last fortnight. Newcastle have to take advantage of home games though. If they don't win this they will be in big trouble, so this is a game they will have highlighted as a must-win. I think they will just get the job done with a cagey victory.PAUL PREDICTS: 1-0 (9/2 with Sky Bet)Wow, another tough one! Watford are on a glass mountain with moccasin slippers! They were on the verge of the top four not too long ago, now, if they lose this game, they are really in trouble. If you take away that win against Leicester they would be in deep trouble. Given the form of these two sides, either of them could win and you wouldn't be shocked, but I'm going for a draw.PAUL PREDICTS: 1-1 (9/2 with Sky Bet)This is a massive game for both of these clubs. West Brom have been knocking on the door under Alan Pardew, they have been playing well but they've not been taking their chances.Salomon Rondon and Jay Rodriguez did find the net in the FA Cup, though. I know it was against Exeter but it makes a difference. They will be full of confidence and, if they keep on making chances, they should end their 20-game winless run in the league.PAUL PREDICTS: 2-0 (7/1 with Sky Bet)Spurs struggled at home to West Ham and it took them a while to break down AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup. But I think they will have too much for an Everton side who are going to sit back and play tight. It has worked for them in the past, but they don't have enough pace on the counter to hurt Tottenham.PAUL PREDICTS: 2-0 (9/2 with Sky Bet)",
