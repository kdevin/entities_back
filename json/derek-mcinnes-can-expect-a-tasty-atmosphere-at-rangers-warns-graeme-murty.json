  "description": "Rangers boss Graeme Murty has warned Derek McInnes to expect a “tasty” reception when he takes his Aberdeen side to Ibrox on Wednesday.",
  "content": "It will be McInnes' first visit to Rangers since turning down the chance to succeed Pedro Caixinha as Gers manager.Rangers confirmed they wanted McInnes, who spent five years at Ibrox as a player, but were declined permission to speak to him.That decision handed Murty his chance and, having racked up back-to-back victories over the Dons during his period as caretaker boss, he is now looking to continue that winning run.\"I don't think any Rangers-Aberdeen game needs any extra edge,\" said Murty. \"There always seems to be something going on.\"Derek made his position perfectly clear. We respect his position.\"He is staying at a good football club, with a good squad that he is putting together really well.\"We have to respect them and respect what they are about but focus on what we're great at and hopefully take the positive energy from doing well against them twice into this game.\"The atmosphere will be tasty but they always are in these games.\""
