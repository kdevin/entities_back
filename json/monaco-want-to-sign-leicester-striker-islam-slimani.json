  "content": "Slimani is not playing regularly, and Leicester are prepared to listen to offers for him with Turkish side Besiktas, Southampton and Newcastle also among a number of interested clubs.Besiktas president, Fikret Orman, was at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday to watch Slimani play against Fleetwood in the FA Cup, and Sky sources understand talks with the Turkish club are ongoing.The 29-year-old has started only one Premier League game since September, scoring just five goals in all competitions this season, and Slimani could be allowed to leave after Leicester boss Claude Puel admitted he has too many strikers at the club.Leicester are understood to be prepared to listen to offers for all of their front men, except Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki.Slimani became Leicester's club-record signing after arriving at the King Power for Â£28m from Sporting following the title-winning season of 2015/16, and the Foxes would be looking to recoup the fee they paid.The Algerian has made 17 appearances for Leicester so far during the current campaign, but has only started one Premier League game since September.Leonardo Ulloa is another player that Leicester would be prepared to let go, if the deal is right.Sky sources understand Aston Villa have made an approach to take him on loan, but a number of other clubs are also interested in the Argentine."
