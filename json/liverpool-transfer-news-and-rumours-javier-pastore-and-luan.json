I always said that I would leave it to Gremio and to my agent, and if they had something concrete, they should talk to me. No one has come to me, so there is nothing.\"It has to be good for me, it has to be good for Gremio. I will not rush to want to leave soon, just like in the middle of last year. For the moment that we were through, I decided to stay. It was my decision alone. Now it's the start of the season and I want to regain my form and rhythm to play.\"Philippe Coutinho made his Barcelona debut in the Copa del Rey on Thursday.And reported Liverpool target James Maddison is the subject of a Â£12m bid from West Ham, according to the Coventry Telegraph.Apparently, Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton are keen on the 21-year-old Norwich midfielder."
