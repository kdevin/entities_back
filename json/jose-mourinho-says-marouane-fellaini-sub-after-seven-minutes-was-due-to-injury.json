He came on with enthusiasm, but he has an injury in his ligament.\"Mourinho brought on the Belgian alongside Juan Mata, bringing off Pogba and Jesse Lingard as United chased the game late on.The United boss batted off criticism for the double change, insisting he wanted to change the dynamic of the game.\"I think I was unlucky with Fellaini as I wanted to change a little bit the dynamic of the team,\" the boss told BT Sport.\"After a couple of minutes, he was injured. It's always the same thing. It is the lateral ligament. I don't think it's a big, big thing but he was immediately feeling something and telling us he couldn't carry on.\""
