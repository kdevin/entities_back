  "description": "David Moyes has refused to be drawn on Chelsea's interest in West Ham striker Andy Carroll, but says he hopes to add to his squad in January rather than sell.",
  "content": "Sky sources understand Chelsea have made contact with the Hammers with the intent of signing Carroll on a permanent deal.But, quizzed about Carroll after West Ham edged past Shrewsbury in the FA Cup, Moyes said: \"They have not made contact with me, so if they have made contact with someone else I don't know about it.\"At the moment Andy Carroll is one of my squad, I want to add to the squad, not lose players.\"I know nothing about it. There have been a lot of rumours regarding a loan but as far as I know it has never officially come from Chelsea. I am not keen to lose any players, I am more keen to add to the squad.\"At the moment Andy has an ankle injury so we are hoping that will settle quickly and he will be back training shortly.\"Moyes also said he has not spoken to the West Ham owners regarding Carroll's future.Reflecting on the cup tie, which saw Reece Burke score an extra-time winner, Moyes said: \"The cup ties are difficult. The expectation is on us to make all the running.\"We started tonight with a lot of young players due to injury and people not being available for the game. I think that expectation might have been too high and I knew with the team we were playing it was going to be touch and go to beat Shrewsbury.\"We always looked the most likely side, albeit we looked as though we couldn't score at the top end and didn't look strong enough in the forward areas to give ourselves a chance.\"It's only really when Marko [Arnautovic] came on did we look as though that was possible. Good credit to Shrewsbury, they did a really good job and made it hard for us to score. Fortunately, we came up with something just before the end.\"",
