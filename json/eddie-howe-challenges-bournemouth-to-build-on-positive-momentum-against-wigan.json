  "content": "The Cherries came from behind to defeat the Gunners 2-1 at the Vitality Stadium on Sunday, a win which lifted the club up to 13th in the Premier League - four points above the relegation places.Bournemouth travel to face Wigan on Wednesday and Howe has challenged his side to extend their five-match unbeaten run.\"Positive momentum is a hard thing to get when you're in the Premier League,\" Howe said. \"We are desperate to continue that and keep the good form that we're in.\"We have to make sure we make the right decisions for the team and the individuals concerned but of course we want to go through.\"To do that, we have to start the game better than we did the first game. I always prefer to look at things positively - it's another game and an opportunity for players to play and do well.\"Bournemouth needed an injury-time equaliser from Steve Cook to salvage a 2-2 draw against Wigan at the Vitality Stadium earlier this month but Howe insists his side did not underestimate their Sky Bet League One opponents.\"We definitely respected Wigan pre-game. I watched many League One games and they did very well in those games, they are better than that level,\" Howe said.\"There was no shock to me at their performance. Maybe I was surprised with some my own players. They know football and how tough these games are.\"Certainly we don't underestimate them going into this one.\"Howe says he won't risk Josh King and Junior Stanislas against the Latics as the pair continue to work their way back to full fitness.\"We don't have any fresh injury concerns ahead of Wednesday night,\" he said. \"We'll still be without Tyrone Mings and Jermain Defoe, the long-term injuries, but we'll also still be without Junior Stanislas and Joshua King.\"They need a training load behind them before they play to ensure that when they do return, they stay back with us.\"",
