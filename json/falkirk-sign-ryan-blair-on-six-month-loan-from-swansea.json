  "content": "The 21-year-old will link up with his old team-mates - having been a graduate of Falkirk's academy and going on to make fifteen appearances for the Scottish club - before moving to Swansea in January 2016, where he is yet to make a senior start.Blair, who played a major role in Swansea under-23's league and cup double success last season, will wear the No 21 shirt during his second stint at The Falkirk Stadium, with the club battling for survival in the Scottish Championship.Speaking to the club's website, Falkirk boss Paul Hartley said: \"We are really pleased to bring Ryan back for the next six months. He has developed really well during his time with Swansea and will provide us with a different option in midfield.\"He joined in with the group for the first time this morning and you can see that it will be a natural transition for him coming back into the club.\"He is, of course, out on loan to try and gain first team action and he will be available for selection for Saturday's match against Morton.\"Blair signed his first professional contract with Falkirk at the start of the 2013/14 season and made his first team debut against Stranraer in the Challenge Cup on 6th September 2014.",
