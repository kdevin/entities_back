  "title": "Leicester boss Claude Puel backs VAR after Kelechi Iheanacho awarded goal against Fleetwood",
  "description": "Claude Puel backed the use of VAR after Leicester became the first team in English football to score a goal via a video assistant referee decision as they overcame the League One side 2-0 at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night.",
  "content": "Kelechi Iheanacho scored in each half but it was his strike 13 minutes from time that required the intervention. Referee Jonathan Moss asked to check if the striker was offside before finishing off Riyad Mahrez's lovely reverse pass.\nReplays showed Iheanacho was onside when the ball was played and the goal stood to see Leicester progress to a fourth-round tie away at Peterborough.\nPuel was pleased with the outcome but, along with Fleetwood manager Uwe Rosler, still expressed some reservations about the use of technology.\n\"I think we saw in the situation that it was important,\" said Puel.\n\"It was a good thing for us. The video is not perfect because we should have had free-kicks for fouls on (Vicente) Iborra but for the goal it was good.\"\nRosler added: \"For me, can they really say he is onside for the second goal or are they guessing? VAR is not 100 per cent clear because we still don't see everything.\n\"But we will see how it goes. There will be problems in the beginning before we get used to it.\"\nIheanacho has found first-team opportunities limited this season but Puel was pleased to see the £25m summer signing from Manchester City play well.\n\"The first half was tough for the team because we played against a strong defensive unit and couldn't find the solution. But in the second half we played quicker and moved the defenders around a bit more and it was a good goal in the first half.\n\"I was happy with his game and he showed a good attitude, worked hard for his team-mates and got between the lines.\n\"His first goal showed a lot of quality and the second was a fantastic move between him and Riyad. It was a good reward for him and the team.\"\nThe opening goal after 43 minutes was not only Leicester's first shot on target of the evening, but the Premier League club's first of the entire tie including the goalless draw at Highbury 10 days ago.\nRosler said: \"If you break the tie down then I think we were the better team in three of the four halves played but in the final one they had too much for us.\n\"They are a Premier League team and you could see that in the end.\"\n",
