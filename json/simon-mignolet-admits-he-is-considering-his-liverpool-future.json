I did not find that a healthy situation for a goalkeeper,\" Mignolet said.\n\"My place on the bench against City confirmed his words. I am not satisfied with that (being dropped) but you have to respect a decision of the trainer.\"\nMignolet now believes that he has more understanding of his position under Klopp, but is not happy with his current situation as the World Cup approaches.\n\"After everything that has happened this season, I know where I stand and the situation has become clearer. I have been in such situations before and have always come out stronger,\" Mignolet said.\n\"I have to think about my future and the World Cup is coming. This situation should not last too long, that is clear. But I cannot say more about it either.\"\nLiverpool are next in action on Monday Night Football when they travel to Swansea, who they beat 5-0 in the reverse fixture on Boxing Day.\n",
