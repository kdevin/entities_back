  "description": "Barnsley have signed striker Kieffer Moore from Ipswich Town for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal.",
  "content": "The Torquay-born 25-year-old had a successful spell on loan in League One with Rotherham this season, scoring 13 goals in all competitions for the Millers.But Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy said late last year Moore would be recalled, and most likely sold, in January just 12 months after linking up with the club from Forest Green in a reported Â£10,000 deal.He failed to score in 11 appearances for the Portman Road club.Moore came through the non-league ranks with Truro City and Dorchester Town before joining Yeovil and he also had a brief spell in Norway with Viking, as well as a short but prolific loan spell with his hometown club.Tykes boss Paul Heckingbottom said: \"Kieffer is an excellent addition to the side and we're really pleased to bring him here. It's a deal that the club has worked hard on and got done quickly, so I'm delighted with that.\"He's a player in top form and will bring something different to improve the side. We were after a player of his qualities, who can offer something different and improve the starting eleven.\"His height will trouble defenders and cause problems, but as a player he's got much more in his locker and will score different types of goals. Kieffer has already been in the local area and knows South Yorkshire now, so I expect him to settle quickly and work hard to get into our team.\""
