  "description": "Burnley manager Sean Dyche says his team should have been awarded a penalty for a foul on Jack Cork in their draw against Newcastle.",
  "content": "Cork was challenged by Paul Dummett in the first half but the referee ruled no offence had been committed, much to Dyche's annoyance.\"Unfortunately, we can't get a penalty. It's a definitely a penalty for Jack Cork, he turns in the box and realises he's not going to get there, throws his body in the way, brings Cork down, it's a definite penalty but we just can't get one.,\" Dyche said.Nick Pope had come to the rescue for Burnley when Newcastle were awarded a penalty as he saved Joselu's spot-kick.Burnley earned the point late on when Karl Darlow diverted a Sam Vokes header into his own net after he had pushed it onto the bar, after Jamaal Lascelles had given the hosts the lead.\"[It's] a very good point, we haven't won but we've taken the game on, particularly as the game went on. We had a soft start and they were the better team. Then we responded after half-time and especially after their goal. And the last seven or eight minutes we were almost camped inside their box, so I was very pleased with the mentality.\"The result leaves Burnley in seventh place, thanks in part to their impressive away form, something they have improved since last season.\"The bigger picture side of things, it's 18 points on the road, last season we got seven in a season, now we've got 18 points on the road, so we can't lose sight of that.\"We've got six players injured at the moment so it's almost a like new group who haven't played together that often, so once they found a few connections on the pitch, I thought we got a bit stronger. A good set-piece from their point of view, then we responded after that and, as I said, the last seven or eight minutes we're more or less in their box, so I'm pleased with that.\"Dyche brought on Aaron Lennon, Georges-Kevin Nkoudou and Sam Vokes, who all had an impact on the game, pleasing their manager in the process.\"I was pleased with all the substitutions; Aaron Lennon has just joined us, he did very well when he came on, GK offers us something different and Vokesy was on the spot, I don't know if they've given it to him.\"",
