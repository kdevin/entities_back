  "description": "Joselu came off the bench to drag Newcastle out of even deeper relegation trouble and deny Swansea a major boost to their Premier League survival hopes.",
  "content": "The former Stoke striker, whose Â£5m signing in August was symbolic of manager Rafael Benitez's transfer window struggle, stabbed home a 68th-minute equaliser just four minutes after his introduction to cancel out Jordan Ayew's opener.Newcastle dominated the first half, but squandered a series of chances and might have conceded a penalty before Ayew struck.But on a day when defeat was simply not an option, they fought back to snatch a 1-1 draw which at least prevented bottom-of-the table Swansea from collecting three points for just the third time in 15 attempts.",
