  "content": "Alli only signed a six-year contract in September 2016 but Tottenham are now keen to renew the England midfielder's deal, although formal talks are yet to take place.\nSpurs hope Alli will sign the new contract before he potentially switches agents with the 21-year-old expected to leave Rob Segal and his company Impact Sports this year when their contract runs out.\nSky Sports News understands Jorge Mendes is the frontrunner to sign Alli to his agency Gestifute but a number of top domestic football agencies, including Stellar, Base Soccer and Unique, have been interested in representing England regular Alli.\nOn the pitch, Alli has struggled for form this season and has admitted finding it difficult to maintain the high standards he has set since joining Tottenham.\nHe scored 18 goals in 37 Premier League games last season, but has only scored five in 21 this campaign although he has recently begun to discover his best form, having been involved in six goals in his last four league matches.\nAlli was signed by Spurs on transfer deadline day in February 2015 for just £5m from MK Dons and has recently been rated by CIES' Football Observatory study as the second most valuable player in the Premier League at £151.7m behind Tottenham team-mate Harry Kane (£172.4m).\n",
