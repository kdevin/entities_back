  "content": "The forward landed in Newcastle by private jet on Wednesday afternoon and completed the first part of a medical before heading to a private hospital for the second part.\nSlimani suffered a thigh injury in training which will sideline him for two weeks, which was initially believed to have scuppered Newcastle's hopes of a permanent deal.\nWest Ham and Monaco remained interested in Slimani despite his injury.\nBut Slimani, who has only started two Premier League games for the Foxes, appears to have opted for a short-term deal at Newcastle.\nSlimani's arrival also means Newcastle have allowed Alexsandar Mitrovic to join Anderlecht, according to Sky sources.\nNewcastle manager Rafa Benitez is in the market for a new striker after missing out on Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge who joined West Brom this week.\nLeicester boss Claude Puel is understood to be happy to allow Slimani to leave despite also allowing Leonardo Ulloa to return to former club Brighton on a loan deal earlier this week.\n",
