  "description": "Brighton winger Soufyan Ahannach has signed a loan deal withÂ Eredivisie side Sparta Rotterdam until the end of the season.",
  "content": "Ahannach arrived at the club from Dutch side Almere City in August 2017, and will now return to the Netherlands for the remainder of the campaign.The 22-year-old, who has not played for the club in the Premier League, made two appearances in the Checkatrade Trophy against Oxford United and Stevenage.Brighton boss Chris Hughton told the club's website: \"Soufyan was brought in initially as a member of the development squad, and to be pushing to breakthrough into the first-team squad, but he has found those opportunities limited during the first half of the season.\"This loan move offers him the chance to go and play regular first-team football with Sparta Rotterdam in the top division in the Dutch League. It is a good move for all parties - the two clubs, but most importantly Soufyan, and this will help his ongoing development.\""
