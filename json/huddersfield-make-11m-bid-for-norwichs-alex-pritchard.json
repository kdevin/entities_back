  "description": "Huddersfield have increased their bid for Alex Pritchard at Norwich to £11m. ",
  "content": "The Yorkshire club reportedly offered £5m earlier this month for the former Tottenham winger.The deal may be complicated by the fact that Norwich's sporting director Stuart Webber was previously the head of football operations at Huddersfield.Webber left in controversial terms last March having been put on gardening leave by chairman Dean Hoyle when he had expressed an interest in moving to Carrow Road.Pritchard, a former England U21 international, joined Norwich from Tottenham for £8m in the summer of 2016.Huddersfield boss David Wagner admitted Pritchard is a player he likes ahead of the FA Cup third-round victory at Bolton Wanderers, though he did admit the inflated market for British players could make a deal difficult.Wagner told The Yorkshire Post: \"I like him but I have my doubts if he will play for us because I know how expensive British players are in this window.\"If we are able to get some British players in they have to be at reasonable prices. At the end. it is all about quality. If it's one new signing with the quality to help us, good.\""
