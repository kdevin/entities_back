  "description": "West Ham manager David Moyes hailed his team's collective performance after they brushed aside Huddersfield with an impressive 4-1 victory at the John Smith's Stadium.",
  "content": "Manuel Lanzini scored twice to add to strikes from Mark Noble and Marko Arnautovic as the Hammers moved up to 11th in the Premier League table.\nWest Ham are upwardly mobile under the Scot, with eight points in their last four away games, and the victory was Moyes' 200th as a Premier League manager.\n\"It's a really big win,\" he said. \"The teams from 10th down, anyone can beat the other on any given day so it's a big win for us.\n\"I was a bit disappointed going in 1-1 at half-time, and we told them that. I was disappointed with bits of our play but right from the off [in the second half], we got a break and Marko scored.\n\"I was delighted with the front two, who caused them problems all day, but it was a real team effort. They all worked hard doing their jobs so I have to praise them all.\"\nMoyes also praised the travelling support who were treated to a clinical display of counter-attacking football after the break, and he hopes the recent improvement in form will attract more players to the club this month.\nMoyes becomes the fourth person to achieve a double century of Premier League wins after Alex Ferguson (528), Arsene Wenger (468) and Harry Redknapp (236) - and the 54-year-old is understandably proud of his achievement.\n\"I am proud because it's not easy to manage in the Premier League,\" he added.\n\"It's difficult to stay in the jobs for a long period of time. I was very fortunate in the early part of my career to have good chairmen who gave me time to collect those wins.\n\"It's a good achievement and there's some really big names who have won those number of games and more as well.\"\n",
