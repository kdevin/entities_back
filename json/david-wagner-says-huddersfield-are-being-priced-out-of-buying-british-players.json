  "content": "Wagner says Norwich midfielder Alex Pritchard is an \"unrealistic target\" because of the price tags put on British players.The Terriers coach suggested he may be forced to look abroad for value for money after bringing in defender Terence Kongolo on loan from AS Monaco.Wagner said: \"I like him (Alex Pritchard) yes, but do I think he will play for us? I have my doubts because I know how expensive British players are especially in this window. It is not realistic for us.\"I am now long enough in England to know what the prices are in this market. This is why we try and go into the loan market.\"If we can go into the British market like we have with Tom Ince and Scott Malone we try and do it. It has to be realistic figure, if not then ok.\"Huddersfield are aiming to strengthen their attacking options after on-loan midfielder Kasey Palmer was recalled by Chelsea.Palmer had spent the last 18 months at the club but missed a number of games in 2017 through injury.The 21-year-old started Huddersfield's first game of the season, a 3-0 win at Crystal Palace, but a hamstring injury kept him out for the next three months.Wagner added: \"I wasn't surprised that Chelsea called him (Palmer) back as he was not involved as much as we thought he would be. I really like him, he is a great guy and he helped us massively especially last season to get us promoted.\"He needs more playing time and unfortunately we were unable to give him that. I not only accept the decision by Chelsea but I understand the decision. I wish Kasey from the bottom of my heart only the very best for the rest of the season.\"Huddersfield are away to Bolton in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday."
