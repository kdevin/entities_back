  "description": "Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino hopes his side's 3-2 win against West Brom raises confidence after moving out of the relegation zone.",
  "content": "The south coast club recovered from Ahmed Hegazi's fourth-minute opener to secure a third win in five visits to The Hawthorns thanks to goals from Mario Lemina, Jack Stephens and James Ward-Prowse.\nSalomon Rondon's header set up a nervy finish but the Saints are up to 14th in the table following a first league win in 13 matches.\n\"It's massive for us the three points, especially for belief and confidence for the players,\" Pellegrino said. \"Most of my players now are fit and physically ready.\n\"We changed a few players from midweek and I think we showed a good level. But it's just one game, we still have to do a lot of things. We've got many important games in front, and we started today.\"\nPellegrino admits his side may have been fortunate to avoid conceding a penalty but believes Michael Oliver could also have awarded a spot-kick to his team following Hegazi's challenge on Shane Long.\nSouthampton will look to build on the victory at home to Liverpool, live on Super Sunday next week, and Pellegrino is refusing to get carried away by a first league win in 13 attempts.\nHe added: \"We have to think game by game because every single week everything can change, but we need to improve our level on the pitch. The points are the consequence of our performance.\"\nIn assessing Guido Carrillo's first start for the Saints, Pellegrino said: \"I think he was OK, he was alive with energy, and he supported well.\n\"He's a dangerous player in the box and he will be an important player because before we didn't have this profile with Charlie [Austin] out injured.\"\n",
