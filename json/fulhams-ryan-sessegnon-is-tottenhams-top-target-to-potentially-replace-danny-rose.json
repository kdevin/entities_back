  "description": "Fulham's Ryan Sessegnon is Tottenham's number one left-back target to potentially replace Danny Rose, Sky Sports News understands.",
  "content": "Although Rose has patched up his relationship with manager Mauricio Pochettino following his summer outburst, the 27-year-old's long-term future at Spurs remains uncertain.Rose was left out of the matchday squad for the second successive Premier League game on Saturday and Pochettino insists he has been protecting his fitness as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury.Rose started against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League last week and is expected to play against Leicester on Tuesday, but he recently stated he was \"fuming\" at being dropped from the squad to play Arsenal.Spurs have been interested in the 17-year-old Sessegnon for more than a year and made a number of inquiries into his availability over the summer, last January, and the summer of 2016, according to Sky sources.Pochettino is understood to be a huge fan of the England U19, who established himself in Fulham's first-team last season and then signed his first pro-deal at Craven Cottage. He can play anywhere on the left-hand side.Manchester United's Luke Shaw, with whom Pochettino worked at Southampton, is understood to be the second-choice-target.Shaw has struggled with injuries since joining United in a Â£27m deal in 2014 and has been unable to break into Jose Mourinho's plans ahead of Ashley Young, but Pochettino would be confident of rediscovering the 22-year-old's potential.United were also one of two clubs along with Chelsea that Rose was keen to join if Spurs had let him leave in the summer, Sky Sports News understands, but Mourinho is also thought to be a Sessegnon admirer."
