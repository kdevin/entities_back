  "content": "The summer of 2016 saw both Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola arrive in Manchester, while Antonio Conte took over at Chelsea and claimed an impressive title win.Here, we look at each top-six club's record in the transfer market before this January window with these selected deals since the current managerial line up was formed in 2016.We're asking you to give your thumbs up or down for their purchases and sales...Since arriving at Old Trafford in 2016, Mourinho has spent around £300m strengthening the squad with varied success.Mourinho, who decided to let Kevin De Bruyne, Mo Salah and Romelu Lukaku leave at Chelsea, has seen several of his ex-players go on to success outside of his stewardship.He led United to the EFL Cup and Europa League last season, but despite bringing in a spine of players in the summer, United are still some way off rivals Man City.Nemanja Matic has impressed, but Victor Lindelof has room to improve and Romelu Lukaku seems to split opinion down the middle.2016 summer signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan saw his form drop, and has left the club for Arsenal, Zlatan Ibrahimovic was signed twice, and club legend Wayne Rooney left after 13 years.Did Jose get these signings and sales correct?Guardiola has strengthened his squad through the signings of Leroy Sane, Gabriel Jesus, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan as City look like strolling to the Premier League title in impressive fashion this season.Much was made of Guardiola's decision to drop Joe Hart and replace him with Claudio Bravo last season, but he seems to have sold that issue this season through the signing of Ederson, who has impressed since his £36m move from Benfica in the summer.Guardiola has also managed to offload attackers Kelechi Iheanacho, Wilfried Bony, Samir Nasri, Steven Jovetic, Nolito and Enes Unal, who were all surplus to requirements at City.Did Pep get these signings and sales correct?Pochettino last season added Victor Wanyama - who he also signed for Southampton - Vincent Janssen and Georges-Kevin N'Koudou as they finished second in the Premier League.Summer 2017 also saw him bolster his squad with record signing Davinson Sanchez, along with Serge Aurier and Fernando Llorente.Pochettino has also overseen the sales of Ryan Mason, Nacer Chadli and Andros Townsend during his time at the club, as well as having little choice in allowing Kyle Walker to sign for Manchester City for £45m.Did Poch get these signings and sales correct?N'Golo Kante, David Luiz and Marcos Alonso proved to be useful signings as Chelsea marched to win the Premier League title in Conte's first season as manager last season.However, he has also allowed the sales of key players in their title-winning side as Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic departed, as well as offloading Oscar to the Chinese Super League for £54m.This summer has also seen him spend in excess of £150m to bring Alvaro Morata, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Antonio Rudiger and, more recently, Ross Barkley, yet the successes of these signings remains to be seen as Chelsea sit third in the Premier League table.Did Conte get these signings and sales correct?Klopp has strengthened Liverpool's squad by signing attacking talents Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.But it is his most recent signing Virgil van Dijk, the £75m signing from Southampton, who could prove to be his most important as Liverpool look to address their defensive problems.He also recruited goalkeeper Loris Karius, however this remains a problem position for the reds, as Klopp seems yet to decide on his preferred choice between Karius and Simon Mignolet.Klopp was seemingly powerless in Philippe Coutinho's recent big-money move to Barcelona, but has generated over £80m from the sales of Christian Benteke, Mamadou Sakho, Jordon Ibe and Joe Allen.Did Klopp get these signings and sales correct?Wenger has looked to strengthen his squad with Granit Xhaka and Shkodran Mustafi, as well as breaking the club's transfer record to sign striker Alexandre Lacazette for £47.7m from Lyon and bringing in Sead Kolasinac on a free transfer from Schalke in the last summer window.He has also overseen the sales of Kieran Gibbs and Francis Coquelin, who started with the club at youth level, as well as offloading Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Liverpool for £34m, yet it remains to be seen whether Wenger will regret this move.Ultimately, Wenger could be judged more on who he sells, with Alexis Sanchez moving to Man Utd and the future of Mesut Ozil still unknown.Did Wenger get these signings and sales correct?",
