He has scored seven goals in 20 appearances so far this season.\nSpurs are considering him as one of a number of options but the club do not expect too much activity next month.\nSky Sports News reported in November that Fulham's Ryan Sessegnon remains a top target while they remain interested in Everton midfielder Ross Barkley.\n",
