  "description": "Alexis Sanchez's move to Manchester United is hinged on Henrikh Mkhitaryan agreeing terms with Arsenal.",
  "content": "That is according to the Armenia international's agent Mino Raiola, who has told Sky Sports News that \"Sanchez is part of Mkhi's deal. Not the other way around. Without him, Sanchez simply cannot go to United\".\nThe agent, who counts Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Romelu Lukaku among his clients, says he proposed the 'Sanchez to Old Trafford, Mkhitaryan to Arsenal' deal more than six weeks ago.\nSky Sports News understands United are leading the chase to sign the Chile international after Manchester City withdrew from negotiations over cost, but Chelsea also hold an interest in the player.\nBut it is understood that, if an agreement can be reached with Arsenal, the deal will be a straight player swap and will not include United paying a transfer fee for Sanchez.\nMkhitaryan has fallen out of favour at Old Trafford, starting only one Premier League game in over two months.\nRaiola told Sky Sports News: \"Mkhi's problems at Man Utd are purely related to playing football. He has no problem with the manager. It is not personal. And he has two and a half years left on his contract. He doesn't have to leave.\"\nWhen asked to rate the chances of a deal being agreed with Arsenal, Raiola said: \"At this moment low, but life is dynamic.\n\"This is a great deal for Arsenal. They need better, younger players and they have to invest. So it's up to Arsenal to put a deal in place and right now a deal is a long way off.\"\n",
