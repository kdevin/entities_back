It's business as usual.\"When Phil wasn't in the team we still played great football and we have still amazing players who can score goals - the likes of Mo [Salah], Sadio, Roberto.\"The fact is he has gone now and we have to think 'What have we got that is going to get the job done?'.\"I have every faith in the boys that we just move on now.
