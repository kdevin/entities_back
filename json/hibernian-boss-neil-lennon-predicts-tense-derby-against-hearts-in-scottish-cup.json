  "description": "Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon believes Sunday’s Edinburgh derby against Hearts – live on Sky Sports – will be a typically tense affair.",
  "content": "Hibs are unbeaten against their capital city rivals in their last nine matches and will face them in the Scottish Cup for the third season in a row.They won 3-1 at Easter Road last year after their initial clash had ended 0-0, while their meeting in 2015/16 ended in a 1-0 victory for Hibs in the replay after the sides had drawn 2-2 at Tynecastle.The sides played out a goalless draw at Tynecastle in the Scottish Premiership over the Christmas period, although the visitors were denied what looked to be a valid goal after Oliver Shaw's shot appeared to cross the line.Despite their positive run of results against their rivals, Lennon is keen to focus on their upcoming encounter as the Scottish top-flight clubs return from their winter break.\"It's a big derby here and every game whets the appetite of the supporters,\" Lennon told Sky Sports News.\"We've had the winter break and I think everyone is itching to get back to the football and there is no better game than Hearts in the Edinburgh derby.\"I think it will be tense. We played them just before the break and there was nothing in the game really - apart from a goal we scored that was disallowed!\"Both sides are trying to recruit and add to their squads at the moment, so it will be interesting to see how both sides line up for the game.\"Psychologically, I think our players are very strong and they enjoy these games.\"We are in this cycle where we are unbeaten in nine games and obviously it's up to the players to keep that run going, whether it be in the league or in the cup.\"It means so much to both sets of fans and every derby is different. The last one is forgotten about and we go on to this one, the atmosphere will be fantastic.\"Hibernian have already signed Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain on loan until the end of the season, while winger Martin Boyle recently committed his future to the club after signing a new contract until the summer of 2021.But Lennon confirmed he is still keen to add to his squad during the January transfer window.\"We are looking for forward-thinking players, although we may have to trim the squad first before we can bring anybody else in,\" he added.\"It's a question of 'wait and see' but we have already lined up some options in a number of positions.\"At this stage of the season we are looking to strengthen but I am very happy with the core of the squad.\"Watch Hearts v Hibernian in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup on Sunday. Coverage begins on Sky Sports Football and Sky Sports Main Event at 2pm.",
