  "description": "Crystal Palace have renewed their interest in Lille defender Ibrahim Amadou and have made a £16m bid, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "Palace held talks with Lille this time last year for the 24-year-old Cameroon-born player, who can also play as a defensive midfielder.Scott Dann has been ruled out for the rest of the season after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury against Manchester City, and Roy Hodgson needs defensive reinforcements in this window to deal with a growing list of absentees.Mamadou Sakho is already out with a serious injury of his own, meaning Palace are down to three fit centre-halves in James Tomkins, Martin Kelly and Damien Delaney.Hodgson has maintained Palace are not a club with \"unlimited resources\", and admitted a centre-back was not a position on his agenda for the transfer window prior to recent injuries.\"The subject of signing another centre-back has never come up because we weren't expecting Sakho and Dann to be out for long periods of time,\" Hodgson said last week.\"But who knows now? There will be discussions. Football is an ever-revolving subject. What you think is good in your team at one time suddenly a moment in time changes it all.\""
