  "content": "An undisclosed fee has been agreed with French Ligue 2 club, Gazelec Ajaccio, for the 22-year-old who can play either as a striker or winger.Diabate, who will become Claude Puel's first signing of the transfer window, will initially join up with Leicester's U23 squad, but could also feature for the first team this season if he impresses the club's coaches.Diabate could be a replacement for Nigeria international Ahmed Musa, who Puel admitted could be leaving the club in January.Musa failed to earn even a place on the bench against Fleetwood in the 0-0 FA Cup draw at the weekend, despite Puel resting a number of starters.When asked if Musa might go in January, the Leicester boss said: \"We will see. Perhaps it could be a possibility. We will see with the player and the opportunity for the club also.\"I need to have discussions about some players.\""
