There was a lot of speculation, false information and even some quite comical claims made,\" Dzeko told Bosnian site klix.ba.\"I felt honoured by Chelsea's interest as they're a club that I respect greatly. There have been so many stories about me leaving Roma over the past few weeks and I'm still here.\"The 31-year-old spent four-and-a-half years with Manchester City prior to his move to the Serie A in 2015 and described Rome as \"home\".\"I'm happy to remain at Roma because Rome has become my home and a very important part of my life,\" he added.\"Roma is my family and I'm happy to carry on playing for this club. There are many challenges ahead and we'll do our best to achieve our goals. It's going to be difficult, but we won't give up.\""
