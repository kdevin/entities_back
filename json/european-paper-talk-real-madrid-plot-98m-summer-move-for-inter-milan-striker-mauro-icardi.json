  "title": "European Paper Talk: Real Madrid plot £98m summer move for Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi",
  "description": "The January transfer window usually sees less business than its summer counterpart. This year, though, major clubs across Europe are plotting big-money deals which could see a new record set for total spend in the mid-season market.",
  "content": "Our friends at Football Whispers have scoured the continental press to bring you the latest transfer rumours.Southampton striker Manolo Gabbiadini is a Bologna transfer target. His agent, Riccardo Orsolini, is keen on bringing his client back to Italy, but Saints may not let him leave in January. (Sky Italia)Real Madrid are ready to pay Mauro Icardi's €110m (£97.7m) release clause next summer. Los Blancos want the Inter striker as they believe they need more firepower up front. (Corriere dello Sport)Radja Nainggolan had agreed personal terms with Guangzhou Evergrande, but the Chinese Communist Party blocked the transfer. The government wants to block over-expensive transfers to try to make the Chinese market less inflated. A January move for the Roma midfielder is now unlikely, but it could be resurrected in the summer. (Gazzetta dello Sport)Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has handed in a transfer request at Borussia Dortmund. The forward is believed to be an Arsenal transfer target. (Bild)Juventus want to sign on-loan Schalke defender Benedikt Howedes permanently. (Bild)Cristiano Ronaldo is desperate to leave Real Madrid after falling out with president Florentino Perez. The Portuguese forward is unhappy that his contract sees him earn less than Lionel Messi and Neymar. His only concrete offer at the moment is from China, which may not appeal to him. (Mundo Deportivo)With Ronaldo keen on a Real Madrid exit in the summer, Manchester United have a few concerns about a potential return to Old Trafford for the Portuguese superstar. They have the financial power to woo him and would like to see him back in Manchester, but spending €100m (£88m) on a 33-year-old and paying him €50m (£44m) a year salary-wise would be a big risk. (AS)Despite being a Real Madrid transfer target, Los Blancos know it will be nearly impossible to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain, as they would have to pay ridiculous money to bring him in from the Ligue 1 side, while his arrival would also disrupt the pay structure in place at the Bernabeu, and risk upsetting the dressing room. (Sport)Despite their poor form, Real Madrid won't change their plans and are unlikely to buy anyone in January. (Marca)Swansea City transfer target Kevin Gameiro isn't thinking about leaving Atletico Madrid. The French forward has decided to stay at the Wanda Metropolitano until at least the summer. (L'Equipe)Emiliano Sala has turned down a move to Brighton to sign a new contract at Nantes. (L'Equipe)"
