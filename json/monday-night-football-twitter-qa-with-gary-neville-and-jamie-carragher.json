  "description": "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher answered your questions in the latest Monday Night Football Twitter Q&A session.",
  "content": "The pair started with a question on managers and analysed the success enjoyed by Roy Hodgson and David Moyes since joining Crystal Palace and West Ham respectively.The debate quickly moved onto the international scene and another new manager as Neville discussed whether former Manchester United team-mate Ryan Giggs will be a success after being handed the Wales job.The panel then pondered Jack Wilshere's contract situation at Arsenal before discussing whether Theo Walcott has been a success or a failure at the Emirates Stadium.There was also a funny moment during discussions about Walcott when Neville made a joke at Carragher's expense as his MNF colleague was trying to answer a question about the England international.It's great viewing as always, so hit play on the video at the top of the page to watch."
