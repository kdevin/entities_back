  "content": "The former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward was sent home from West Ham's training ground on Monday with the flu.Hernandez's form for the Hammers has come under question in recent weeks, with the Â£17m forward failing to find the back of the net.Mexican star Hernandez was bought as part of a summer revamp of the forward line, arriving at the London Stadium along with Marko Arnautovic from Stoke City.As reported by Sky Sports last week, Hernandez could well be set for an early departure from the club, with the West Ham hierarchy open to hearing offers for the player.Meanwhile, Andy Carroll (ankle), Michail Antonio (groin), Jose Fonte (calf), Edimilson Fernandes (ankle) and Winston Reid (groin) are all out for the Hammers.Provisional squad: Adrian, Hart, Masuaku, Cresswell, Collins, Zabaleta, Ogbonna, Kouyate, Rice, Noble, Obiang, Cullen, Burke, Quina, Lanzini, Arnautovic, Ayew, Hernandez."
