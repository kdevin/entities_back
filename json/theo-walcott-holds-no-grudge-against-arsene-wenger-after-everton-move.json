That's why I've moved on.\"I've known [Wenger] since I was 16. To bring a young player in and to have belief in him, I can't thank him enough for that.\"Walcott was linked with a return to his former club Southampton but says the chance to work with Sam Allardyce was a big factor in his decision to move to Goodison Park.\"After speaking to the gaffer, particularly Wayne (Rooney) as well, I felt like the club was on the up,\" he said.\"The manager seems to get the best out of players, especially when first coming in.
