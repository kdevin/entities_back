I must be honest, I didn't see it - I said to the referee I didn't see it - but with the technology that we have at the moment, after one minute my assistant said it was a clear penalty and a red card.\n\"I am absolutely sure that would have been a red card and a penalty, absolutely sure. In 10 seconds, the video referee would give a communication saying, 'Stop, penalty and red card', I am absolutely sure.\"\nSwansea went on to take the lead on the hour-mark when Jordan Ayew headed past 'keeper Karl Darlow at the second time of asking, although Magpies sub Joselu pegged them back eight minutes later to earn Newcastle a point.\nShould Swansea have been awarded a penalty?
