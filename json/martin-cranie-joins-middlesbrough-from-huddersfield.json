  "description": "Middlesbrough have signed Huddersfield defender Martin Cranie for an undisclosed fee.",
  "content": "The 31-year-old was a regular in David Wagner's side for the second half of last season, helping Huddersfield earn promotion to the Premier League, but has made just three top-flight appearances in this campaign.Cranie, whose contract with the Terriers was due to expire at the end of the season, can play at either right-back or in the middle of the defence.Cranie joins Everton midfielder Muhamed Besic, who will spend the remainder of the season on loan at Boro.Huddersfield signed Monaco defender Terence Kongolo on loan until the end of the season at the start of the January transfer window.Reflecting on Cranie's departure, Huddersfield head coach Wagner said: \"Given the recent arrival of Terence Kongolo and the return to fitness of both Michael Hefele and Jon Gorenc Stankovic, Martin's opportunities at the club have become limited.\"Martin was a big part of the squad during the promotion-winning season and this is a good opportunity for him to go and play regular football.\""
