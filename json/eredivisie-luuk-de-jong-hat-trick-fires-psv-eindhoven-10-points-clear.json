  "description": "Luuk de Jong scored a hat-trick as PSV Eindhoven moved 10 points clearÂ at the top of the Eredivisie with a 4-0 thrashing of 10-man PEC Zwolle on Saturday.",
  "content": "Visiting goalkeeper Mickey van der Hart was sent off shortly before half-time after charging out of his area and clattering into the onrushing Hirving Lozano.The home side quickly made their extra man count as De Jong opened the scoring in first-half injury time, with the 27-year-old converting from close range twice in seven second-half minutes to seal a comfortable win.Joshua Brenet completed the rout in the 78th minute as PSV moved 10 points clear of Ajax at the top of the table.Elsewhere, Daniel Hoegh's 66th-minute goal was enough for Heerenveen to beat FC Twente 1-0 and see the visitors drop to 16th in the table.And Heracles Almelo and ADO Den Haag had to settle for a point apiece as Reuven Niemeijer's 54th-minute strike cancelled out an early opener from Bjorn Maars for the visitors.",
