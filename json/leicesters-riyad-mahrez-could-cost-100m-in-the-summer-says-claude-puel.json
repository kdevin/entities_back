  "description": "Leicester boss Claude Puel says Riyad Mahrez could be worth £100m in the summer transfer window and insisted the winger is enjoying life at the King Power Stadium.",
  "content": "The Frenchman has said Mahrez will not be allowed to leave Leicester in January following reported interest from Liverpool and Arsenal.\nMahrez, who struggled under former boss Craig Shakespeare, has rediscovered his form since Puel's arrival in October and now boasts seven goals and seven assists for the campaign.\nPuel expects the Algeria international to demand a hefty fee if he secures a move away from Leicester after seeing an inflation in transfer prices.\nWhen asked if Mahrez will cost £100m, Puel said: \"Perhaps; maybe in the summer he will cost even more than £100m.\n\"It's just rumours, noise about him. We can see Riyad smile, enjoying his football, enjoying to play with his team-mates.\n\"After the training session he continues to play, I wanted him to stay rested, but it's perfect.\"\nAnother player who has been linked with a move away from Leicester is Harry Maguire. Sky Sports News understands he is admired by Manchester City, although Pep Guardiola's side are unlikely to make a move for him this month.\nWhen asked about Maguire, Puel said: \"He improved a lot since I came here and he continued to develop his play. More anticipation, reading of the play and good quality with the ball.\n\"It's important he continues his hard work. It's a good feeling with him and with the national team he is a valuable player.\"\n",
