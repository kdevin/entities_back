  "description": "Napoli moved four points clear at the Serie A summit on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over Atalanta in Bergamo.",
  "content": "Dries Mertens settled the early kick-off after 65 minutes, accepting Jose Callejon's through ball to fire home an angled drive for his 14th goal of the season and earn the Partenopei a measure of revenge for their Coppa Italia defeat to the Nerazzurri earlier this month.The goal marked the end of a 910-minute drought for Belgium forward Mertens.Second-placed Juventus host Genoa on Monday night but Lazio climbed above Inter Milan and into third with a thumping 5-1 triumph over Chievo despite an injury to Serie A top-scorer Ciro Immobile.Lazio went ahead through Luis Alberto on 23 minutes, were pegged back by Manuel Pucciarelli's goal two minutes later only to then regain the lead through Sergej Milinkovic-Savic just after the half hour.Immobile, who has scored 20 league goals this season, limped off shortly afterwards.Chievo were awarded a penalty in first-half stoppage time for a foul by Senad Lulic on Mariusz Stepinksi but the referee changed his mind after consulting the video replay system (VAR).And Milinkovic-Savic scored the third with a brilliant volley on 68 before Bastos and Nani added two more in the final 10 minutes to floor the Flying Donkeys.Inter later drew level on points with Lazio as they earned a 1-1 draw against Roma.Stephan El Shaarawy put Roma ahead after 31 minutes, latching on to a long clearance by goalkeeper Alisson to lift the ball over Samir Handanovic.Alisson twice denied Mauro Icardi with brilliant saves in the second half but was powerless when Matias Vecino rose between two defenders to head in Marcelo Brozovic's cross after 86 minutes.Fabio Quagliarella hit a hat-trick in Sampdoria's 3-1 victory over fellow European hopefuls Fiorentina at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.Carlos Sanchez pulled a goal back for La Viola with a header 10 minutes from time, but it was scant consolation.Franck Kessie scored two goals in six minutes as AC Milan came from behind to beat Cagliari 2-1.Nicola Barella put the hosts ahead in just the eighth-minute but Kessie's two-goal salvo levelled before the break, the first coming from the spot.Both sides finished with 10 men as Ricardo Rodriguez and Barella both saw red in the final 10 minutes.Mattia Destro, Sebastian De Maio and Blerim Dzemaili scored as Bologna cruised to a 3-0 success against rock-bottom Benevento, while Crotone ran out 3-0 winners at 10-man Hellas Verona in a battle between two teams in the bottom three at the start of play.The games between Sassuolo and Torino, and Udinese and SPAL, ended 1-1."
