We obviously came into the job and got it for a reason because the team hadn't been winning games,\" said Coyle, who took charge at Global Energy Stadium last November.\n\"We did very well in October and November but we've not done well as of late.\n\"The only way to change that is with playing well and winning games.\n\"We've no doubt we can turn that around very quickly and obviously that starts with a huge game against Rangers on Sunday.\"\nThe last meeting between the clubs went Rangers way, as they came from behind to seal a late 2-1 win at Ibrox, and Coyle admits his side must show more defensive quality if they are to turn \"tight results\" into positive ones.\n\"There's been a lot of games that we've just been on the wrong side of a tight result, and Rangers was the same as that,\" he said.\n\"We went 1-0 in front and did very well in the game.\n\"We've got to still carry that threat to score goals, but again be more defensively sound and not give away soft goals.\"\n",
