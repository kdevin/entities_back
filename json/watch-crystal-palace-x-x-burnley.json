  "description": "Crystal Palace took a further step towards Premier League survival with a 1-0 victory over Burnley which extended the visitors' winless run to seven games.",
  "content": "The Clarets climbed to fourth in the table after beating Stoke last month but have struggled to impress since, and came up short again against a Palace side missing eight first-team regulars.A second goal in two games from Bakary Sako was enough to secure the three points for the Eagles, taking them up to 12th and into serious contention for a top-10 finish having looked like near-certainties for relegation a few months ago."
