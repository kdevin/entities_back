  "description": "Chris Hughton has praised the battling display from his side after Brighton drew 1-1 with Southampton.",
  "content": "Brighton took a first-half lead through Glenn Murray's penalty at St Mary's but were denied victory as Jack Stephens scored Southampton's equaliser in the 64th minute.The draw does little to help Brighton's rise up the table as they are only one point above the relegation zone in 15th. But Hughton was happy with his side's display in a game where they had far less of the ball.\"We were well worthy of the point we got,\" Hughton told Sky Sports after the game.\"When you play away, and with the players they've got, you'd expect them to have good possession and to threaten but I think we restricted them to one half-chance or so.\"We were resilient at what we did and had a very good opportunity once we got into that final third and we took it. So overall, I'm reasonably happy.\"Even though Brighton did not get the win they were looking for, Hughton has challenged his players to reach the level required to survive in the Premier League.He added: \"This is the time for players to step up and it's become quite obvious that going into this last third of the season it's going to be the team that stands out from the rest that survives.\"Whether that's through resilience or scoring the odd goals or turning defence into attacks... whichever way it is they've got to show it a bit more than the others.\""
