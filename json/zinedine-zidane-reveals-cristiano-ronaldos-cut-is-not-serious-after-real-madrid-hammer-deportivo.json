  "content": "The Portugal international left the field with blood streaming down his face after being caught by defender Fabian Schar as he dived to head home Real's sixth goal at the Bernabeu Stadium.\nBut speaking at his post-match press conference, Zidane said: \"He has got a wound and I think he's been given two or three stitches. He's all right.\"\nRonaldo's injury was the only sour note on a day when Zidane's team roared back into top form to answer their critics in style.\nThe was concern among the home ranks when Adrian fired the visitors into a 23rd-minute lead to suggest Real's three-game losing LaLiga run might be extended.\nHowever, Nacho's equaliser and a double from Gareth Bale either side of half-time set the scene for a rampant conclusion.\nAsked about Bale's contribution, Zidane said: \"I always want to have all of my players available. Whenever they're not around, it makes me unhappy.\n\"We're without two centre-backs at the moment and I'm not happy about it. That's the way it goes in football.\n\"We need to remind ourselves that when one player gets injured, we've always someone else to come in and do a good job. I'm happy for Gareth because he's producing some consistent performances.\"\nLuka Modric made sure of victory with a sweet 68th-minute strike before Ronaldo helped himself to a double and Nacho completed his own brace two minutes from time.\nZidane said: \"It's always great and a positive feeling to win, netting seven goals at home. It's not every day you get seven goals at the Bernabeu, so we're thrilled with that today.\"\n",
