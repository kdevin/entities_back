He's all right.\"Ronaldo's injury was the only sour note on a day when Zidane's team roared back into top form to answer their critics in style.The was concern among the home ranks when Adrian fired the visitors into a 23rd-minute lead to suggest Real's three-game losing LaLiga run might be extended.However, Nacho's equaliser and a double from Gareth Bale either side of half-time set the scene for a rampant conclusion.Asked about Bale's contribution, Zidane said: \"I always want to have all of my players available. Whenever they're not around, it makes me unhappy.\"We're without two centre-backs at the moment and I'm not happy about it. That's the way it goes in football.\"We need to remind ourselves that when one player gets injured, we've always someone else to come in and do a good job. I'm happy for Gareth because he's producing some consistent performances.\"Luka Modric made sure of victory with a sweet 68th-minute strike before Ronaldo helped himself to a double and Nacho completed his own brace two minutes from time.Zidane said: \"It's always great and a positive feeling to win, netting seven goals at home. It's not every day you get seven goals at the Bernabeu, so we're thrilled with that today.\"",
