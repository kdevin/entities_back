  "content": "The 26-year-old did not turn up for training on Thursday or Friday last week and missed the defeat at Everton and Saturday's 1-1 draw with Swansea after his proposed move to Manchester City collapsed on Deadline Day.\nMahrez handed in a transfer request in a bid to push through a move to the Etihad and Sky Sports News understands he was left \"depressed\" by Leicester's decision not to accept City's final player-plus-cash offer worth an estimated £65m.\nMadjer understands Mahrez wants to play for a \"bigger club\" but has advised him to return to training with his Leicester team-mates.\n\"Mahrez currently deserves better than Leicester. But we must not forget that it was Leicester who put him on the right track,\" Madjer told Goal.\n\"I think a serious conversation with his board is needed. He wants to go to a bigger club in the English league. I do not know what really happened about his transfer.\n\"Me, I advise him to resume training and work hard, even if the transfer has not been resolved.\"\n",
