I would like to wish him all the very best for the future on behalf of everyone at the club.\"LuaLua began his career with Newcastle United before he joined Brighton permanently in 2011 and scored 22 goals in his 83 appearances for the Seagulls.Coleman says he is looking forward to working with LuaLua at Sunderland, who are currently 22nd in the Sky Bet Championship.\"Kaz was determined to come here and get playing first-team football again and I look forward to helping him play the kind of football he is capable of,\" Coleman told Sunderland's official website.\"He's quick, skilful and has a lot of experience at this level. He gives us another option in attack and, most importantly, is up for the fight.\"",
