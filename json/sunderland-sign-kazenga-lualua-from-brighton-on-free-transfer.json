  "description": "Sunderland have completed the signing of Kazenga LuaLua from Brighton on a short-term deal until the end of the season.",
  "content": "Brighton reached an agreement to cancel LuaLua's contract with immediate effect on Thursday, leaving the 27-year-old available to join Chris Coleman's side on a free transfer after Sunderland had enquired about the winger.The 27-year-old spent the first half of the season on loan at QPR, but returned to Brighton this month after making only eight appearances.Brighton boss Chris Hughton credited LuaLua's hard work and admitted it had been difficult for him to get as much game time as he would have liked.Hughton told Brighton's official website: \"The competition for places in our wide areas means that it has been very difficult for Kazenga to play the number of matches he would have liked here.\"He has worked tremendously hard during his time with us and has played a major part in the club's history. I would like to wish him all the very best for the future on behalf of everyone at the club.\"LuaLua began his career with Newcastle United before he joined Brighton permanently in 2011 and scored 22 goals in his 83 appearances for the Seagulls.Coleman says he is looking forward to working with LuaLua at Sunderland, who are currently 22nd in the Sky Bet Championship.\"Kaz was determined to come here and get playing first-team football again and I look forward to helping him play the kind of football he is capable of,\" Coleman told Sunderland's official website.\"He's quick, skilful and has a lot of experience at this level. He gives us another option in attack and, most importantly, is up for the fight.\""
