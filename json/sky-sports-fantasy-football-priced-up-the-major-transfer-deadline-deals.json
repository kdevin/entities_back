  "title": "Sky Sports Fantasy Football priced up the major transfer deadline deals",
  "description": "A final flurry of transfer activity made for an exciting end to the January window, but how highly are the Premier League's late additions rated in fantasy football terms?",
  "content": "Plenty of money was spent in the process, with both Arsenal and Manchester City splashing out record fees, landing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Aymeric Laporte.Featuring some Premier League newbies and a couple of familiar names, we rate the biggest deals of the last few days and weigh up their worth based on Sky Sports Fantasy Football prices...Aymeric LaporteSky Sports Fantasy Football valuation: £8.5mAymeric Laporte started life in England faultlessly in midweek, keeping a clean sheet and completing 72 passes just hours after his record-breaking £57m move to Manchester City was announced.The Spaniard has made more blocks, clearances and tackles per 90 minutes this season than both Nicholas Otamendi (£8.6m) and John Stones (£8.9m), as well as key passes, but can he displace one of them in Pep Guardiola's team?He certainly suggested as much against West Brom, and he comes into Sky Sports Fantasy Football rather reasonably priced as City's cheapest centre-back.Pierre-Emerick AubameyangSky Sports Fantasy Football valuation: £12.2mInvolved in 16 goals in 16 Bundesliga games this season - with 13 goals and three assists - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's £60m move to Arsenal is one that promises to light up the Premier League.A reunion with Henrikh Mkhitaryan makes the move particularly exciting, with the duo combining directly for 11 goals in their last season together at Borussia Dortmund.Aubameyang's price tag of £12.2m makes him the fifth most expensive player in Sky Sports Fantasy Football - costing slightly more than team-mate Alexandre Lacazette (£11.8m), who was the Gunners' record signing before the arrival of the Gabon international.But if he can make an impact like fellow Premier League newbie Alvaro Morata (£12.2m) - who's scored 10 goals since his £58m move to Chelsea in the summer - then he will no doubt become a popular pick in the game.Lucas MouraSky Sports Fantasy Football valuation: £9.9mDespite scoring 12 goals and providing five assists last term, Tottenham's new signing Lucas Moura has rarely featured for Paris Saint-Germain this season.The Brazilian still has one goal and one assist from 72 minutes of football this term though, the same totals Moussa Sissoko has from 1106 minutes, and brings with him a winning mentality - all for just £25m.That's translated into a Sky Sports Fantasy Football fee of just £9.9m, putting him in the same price range as rotatory players Juan Mata (£9.7m) and Pedro (£9.5m), although you could purchase two of this season's biggest stars, Mohamed Salah (£9.4m) and Raheem Sterling (£9.8m), for less.Daniel SturridgeSky Sports Fantasy Football valuation: £11.1mAfter scoring 21 goals in 29 Premier League games back in 2013-14, Daniel Sturridge has struggled with injuries and scored just 17 goals in the competition since.Unable to break into Liverpool's free-scoring side, he moves to West Bromwich Albion on loan and becomes their most expensive player in Sky Sports Fantasy Football, at £11.1m.If he can return to the form that made him one of the country's deadliest finishers, then that is a price he is worth.However, better value for money could be found elsewhere in the likes of Son Heung-min (£10.8m) and Anthony Martial (£10.7m) - or even Baggies top-scorer Jay Rodriguez (£9.4m).Gerard DeulofeuSky Sports Fantasy Football valuation: £8.2mWell known for two stints with Everton, Gerard Deulofeu is back in the Premier League - this time with Watford.His performances during the 2015-16 season were his highlight, where he registered eight assists and two goals in the league while helping the Toffees reach the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup.If he can make that sort of impact at Vicarage Road then his moderate £8.2m price tag will be great value for money, one that makes him significantly cheaper than the likes of Wilfried Zaha (£9.3m) and Theo Walcott (£9.2m).His arrival could also help reignite the seasons of some of Sky Sports Fantasy Football's early surprise packages - particularly Abdoulaye Doucoure (£7m) and Richarlison (£7.6m).",
