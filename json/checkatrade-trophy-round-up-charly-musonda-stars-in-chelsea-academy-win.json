  "description": "Charly Musonda scored twice for Chelsea Academy as they beat Portsmouth 2-1 to reach the quarter-finals of the Checkatrade Trophy.",
  "content": "The 21-year-old's 58th-minute effort appeared to be enough for victory before Brett Pitman hit back for Pompey at Fratton Park, but with the game seemingly heading to penalties, Musonda netted again for the Blues to see off the Sky Bet League One side.Elsewhere, Oxford and Peterborough required penalties to make it through to the last eight. Oxford won 3-0 in the shootout after a 1-1 draw at Charlton, while Peterborough's 7-6 win on penalties at Luton was far more entertaining than the goalless draw that came before it.Jordy Hiwula netted twice as Fleetwood beat League One strugglers Bury 3-2 at Gigg Lane, and Yeovil beat fellow League Two club Forest Green 2-0 thanks to goals from Nathan Smith and Connor Smith.An 88th-minute Oliver Palmer goal was enough for Lincoln to win 1-0 at Rochdale and book their place in the draw for the quarter-final, which takes place on EFL Matters on Thursday night, live on Sky Sports Football from 7pm.",
