  "description": "Borussia Dortmund have criticised Arsene Wenger after the Arsenal manager said Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang would fit in at the Emirates.",
  "content": "Wenger insisted on Thursday that the proposed exchange involving Alexis Sanchez and Manchester United's Henrikh Mkhitaryan was their only January deal close to completion.But the Frenchman did not rule out a move for Aubameyang, who has not travelled with the rest of the Dortmund squad for Saturday's game at Hertha Berlin, according to Sky Germany.Wenger said the striker would be suited to life at Arsenal, prompting an angry response from Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc.\"We think it's disrespectful to talk like this about other players. There is no contact with Arsenal,\" said Zorc.\"We assume that Mr Wenger has enough to do with the performance of his own players.\"Borussia Dortmund manager Peter Stoger said on Thursday that Aubameyang could earn his place back in the team if he showed a willingness to improve his off-the-pitch behaviour.The forward was left out of Dortmund's squad for last week's match against Wolfsburg over disciplinary issues.Stoger held talks with Aubameyang on Monday and insisted the player would be under consideration for this weekend's fixture unless circumstances changed.\"I'm planning the future with him, if he improves his work,\" said Stoger. \"If something changes, I would be informed. As long as this is not happening, he is in my plans. If he behaves like he behaves right now, he will be in the squad tomorrow.\"Asked if he has given up hope of Aubameyang staying, Stoger added: \"I've given up holding hope for any players. Many things can't be planned.\"You can't expect that everything works out like you want it. You have to be able to have the right thought in the short-term.\""
