  "description": "Luton have signed Ipswich midfielder Flynn Downes on loan until the end of the season.",
  "content": "The 19-year-old has impressed for Ipswich this campaign and signed a three-year contract at Portman Road soon after turning professional in the summer.He has made five starts among his 11 appearances, including his full debut when Mick McCarthy's side came to Kenilworth Road in the Carabao Cup in August.Downes made his England U19 debut this campaign, playing against Germany in September, and has since won three caps in their European Championship qualifying campaign.He becomes the second player to arrive at Kenilworth Road on Deadline Day, after Liverpool defender Lloyd Jones signed for the club earlier on Wednesday.\"Flynn is a young Championship player who Ipswich have big hopes for,\" Hatters boss Nathan Jones told the club's official website.\"We don't take many loans, but we knew about him and once we were made aware he'd become available, we felt it was worth the chance to take him.\"He's a real energetic, combative midfield player. We know what type of character and what type of worker he is, because he's one that Mick McCarthy likes - and if Mick McCarthy likes him we know we are getting a real top midfield player.\"We are delighted that Mick was very complimentary about our environment and how we play. He was instrumental in allowing Flynn to come out and get more experience with us.\""
