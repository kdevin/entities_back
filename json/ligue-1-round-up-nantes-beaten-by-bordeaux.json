  "description": "Nantes missed the chance to close the gap on Ligue 1's top four after a 1-0 home defeat to Bordeaux left them without a win in three matches.",
  "content": "Nicolas de Preville headed the only goal midway through the first half to secure Bordeaux victory.Santy Ngom and Emiliano Sala both went close to rescuing a point for Nantes in stoppage time, but they remain nine points adrift of fourth-placed Monaco.Moussa Konate's double helped secure Amiens their first victory in seven league games as they won 3-1 at home against Guingamp, who slipped to back-to-back defeats.Konate converted a first-half penalty and after that had been cancelled out by Marcus Coco, the Senegal forward struck again before Mathieu Bodmer's emphatic finish sealed the points.Giovanni Sio's stoppage-time winner clinched Montpellier a 2-1 home win against 10-man Toulouse, who almost held on for a point after the first-half dismissal of forward Max Gradel.Giannelli Imbula fired Toulouse into a first-half lead before Gradel was shown a straight red card in the 41st minute for his challenge on Jerome Roussillon.Salomon Sambia equalised for Montpellier direct from a free-kick two minutes later and Sio turned home the winner from close range in the fifth minute of added time.Rennes made it back-to-back league wins thanks to Benjamin Bourigeaud's late penalty in a 1-0 home victory against Angers, who had Congo midfielder Prince Oniangue sent off shortly before half-time for two yellow card offences.Kenny Lala converted two penalties as Strasbourg halted a run of three successive league defeats with a 3-2 home win against Dijon.Jean Eudes Aholou and Lala's first penalty put Strasbourg 2-0 up midway through the first half and although Dijon hit back to level through Julio Tavares and Oussama Haddadi, Kala's second spot-kick with 11 minutes left extended Dijon's winless league run to four matches.Troyes climbed out of the bottom three courtesy of Adama Niane's solitary strike in a 1-0 home win against Lille, who dropped into the relegation zone.",
