  "description": "Bristol City midfielder Bobby Reid believes his side can overturn a first-leg deficit against Manchester City in their Carabao Cup semi-final.",
  "content": "The Premier League leaders needed a stoppage-time winner from Sergio Aguero to claim a slender 2-1 advantage for the second leg on January 23, live on Sky Sports.Pep Guardiola's side will be favourites but Bristol City did lead at half-time through Reid's 44th-minute penalty and will fancy their chances at home.Reid said: \"I think with the crowd behind us it will be a different atmosphere. It's a closed-in stadium and the fans are right on top. The fans will be buzzing, right behind us.\"We'll still play with that energy and desire and who knows how it will go?\"Asked if he felt a victory was possible, Reid said: \"100 per cent. There's only one goal in it. 1-0 would be enough.\"The Championship side have already beaten Manchester United at Ashton Gate this season. United were their fourth top-flight scalp in the competition after victories over Watford, Stoke and Crystal Palace.Bristol City's lead in the tie lasted until the 55th minute when Kevin De Bruyne cancelled out Reid's first-half penalty.Aguero came off the bench to head in the winner but Reid says it has given his team-mates a taste of what Premier League football would be like.He added: \"They move the ball well and at any given time they can do something special, but we worked hard to move the ball and we showed we can play good football as well.\"You have to give them a bit of respect but not so much that they can just roll you over.\"We want to be in the Premier League and we want to be playing the best teams in the Premier League. We want to showcase our skills against the best and play them.\""
