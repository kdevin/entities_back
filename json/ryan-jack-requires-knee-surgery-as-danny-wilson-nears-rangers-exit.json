  "description": "Rangers midfielder Ryan Jack requires knee surgery and will be out for an extended period while Danny Wilson is undergoing a medical ahead of a projected move to Colorado Rapids.",
  "content": "Jack, 25, suffered a knee injury during Rangers' win over Motherwell on December 27 and manager Graeme Murty confirmed he requires an operation.\"He will be having surgery on his knee,\" said Murty. \"It didn't present that way initially but he will be out for an extended period.\"It's premature to say he'll be out for the season but we will make sure that we get the prognosis after his surgery. We're mindful of his long-term recovery.\"While Jack must go under the knife, Ross McCrorie does not require surgery on his injured foot and Murty says he will be sidelined for weeks rather than months.\"Thankfully the specialist thinks it's just a matter of time. He doesn't need surgery, he won't need an injection,\" Murty said.\"It's just a question of being patient with it and waiting until any inflammation and pain symptoms go away.\"It's quite difficult putting the reins on a 19-year-old that has been playing for Rangers' first-team. To tell him he has to rest, it's quite frustrating for the guy, but we have to make sure we safeguard his long-term future at the club.\"He understands that, as painful as it is for him at the moment to miss out.\"Wilson undergoing medicalOn the transfer front, Murty confirmed Wilson is undergoing a medical but refused to reveal whether the defending is joining MLS side Colorado.\"Danny has options,\" he said. \"Until those options are concluded and we have a definitive answer, that will stay in-house.\"While Wilson prepares to leave, Murty is delighted to have brought in midfielder Greg Docherty from Hamilton and has backed the 21-year-old to break into the Scotland team.When asked what Docherty can bring to Rangers, Murty replied: \"He adds a bit of physicality, legs, the ability to go box-to-box. He is technically proficient and has a range of passing.\"Typically in the past, outstanding Rangers midfield players have been internationals - Ryan Jack is an international.\"That's [Docherty's] challenge, to be an international player while at Rangers. If he does that he will be on the path to fulfilling some of his potential.\"We're just going to try and give him a stage to get as far as he possibly can in the game.\""
