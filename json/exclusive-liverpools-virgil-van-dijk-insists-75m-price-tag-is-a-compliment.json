I can't change anything about that.\"Chelsea and current Premier League leaders Manchester City were thought to be interested in the defender over the past year, but Van Dijk chose Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool after a move broke down in the summer.Asked why he chose Liverpool, Van Dijk, who also played for Celtic for two seasons, said: \"I think the size of the club, the fans, the players, the manager, the whole package here is amazing.\"You can see yourself that the atmosphere at every home game is amazing. I'm just very happy to play for the club.\"You can catch the extended interview between Carragher and Van Dijk on the Premier League Today programme, on Sky Sports Premier League from 6pm on Friday.And you can catch Liverpool v Man City on Super Sunday from 3.30pm on Sky Sports Premier League"
