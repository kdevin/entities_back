  "description": "Watford boss Javi Gracia praised the impact of new signing Gerard Deulofeu after watching his side draw 0-0 with Stoke at the Bet365 Stadium.",
  "content": "The Spanish winger, whose arrival was announced on Tuesday morning, has joined the Hornets on loan from Barcelona until the end of the season, and the manager was full of praise for the former Everton and AC Milan player despite his new side failing to break down the Potters in a game of few chances.Gracia said: \"Gerard played well. He made a big effort to give the team defensive balance and on the right he also created many chances. I'm happy with his work and I hope he improves day by day like the level of the team.\"Deulofeu was instrumental in setting up Richarlison for the visitors but the Brazilian prodded wide, and Jose Holebas came close to winning the game for Watford when Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland turned his first-half header against the bar.\"I enjoyed it a lot,\" said Gracia. \"I know this match was tough and had a lot of physical intensity but we tried to look for a good result. I thought we had more control in the first half than the second. There were more chances for both sides but it was the first time we kept a clean sheet for 12 matches and we got a point. We'll try to get the three points next time at home.\"We need to play with intensity. We need to play hard because this way is the beginning to playing well. After that we have other qualities and other values but number one is aggression and intensity. After that comes the second.\"Gracia's tenure began with a 1-0 defeat to Southampton in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, but the former Malaga coach saw his side climb a place to 11th on his Premier League bow.\"We are always focused on the next match,\" said Gracia. \"Today we are not completely happy but we are happy because we worked in the best way and got a point. We also kept a clean sheet and we must continue with that.\""
