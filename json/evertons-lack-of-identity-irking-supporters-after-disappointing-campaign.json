  "content": "A season that promised so much effectively came to an end at the hands of their city rivals before the first weekend of January. After a summer of substantial and unparalleled investment in the side, Everton were many pundits' bet to muscle into the top six reckoning. But despite this view - largely held from afar - within the supporter base there was an element of concern, even after Wayne Rooney crowned his return to Goodison Park with the winning goal in the opening-day victory over Stoke.The eye-catching sums invested in Jordan Pickford and record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson as part of a Â£150m spend were only part of the summer transfer story.\"I don't think the structure of the team helped at all,\" says the Liverpool Echo's match-day reporter Tony Scott. \"No right-back, no left-back, no centre-forward and lots of Number 10s. The team was totally unbalanced and that was [Director of Football] Steve Walsh's priority.\"It seems to be a scattergun approach. Something that I would do myself if I won the lottery,\" Downie says. \"Go out and spend a load of money on things that I think look amazing and then when I get back home I'd look at them and say, 'Do I really need them?' We don't quite know where to put the money or where to invest. We've got a fantastic youth set-up at the club and some of those players are being held back by the ones we've paid money for.\"A case in point would be 20-year-old Ademola Lookman, one of a number of promising youngsters at Goodison Park. In the recent FA Cup derby at Anfield, Lookman came off the bench and played an important part in the equaliser, causing Liverpool more problems than a previously quiet Wayne Rooney. Yet for the next game, that demoralising defeat 4-0 at Spurs, he was consigned to a watching role as an unused substitute.Shareholder John Blain runs the Everton Business Matters podcast. He believes fans will become far happier once there is more clarity about the structure of the football operation. \"We had the Annual General Meeting last week and even then there was banter between Director of Football Steve Walsh and manager Sam Allardyce about who has the final say.There is a sense of waste among supporters after hopes were raised so much. To see the team struggling in the league is nothing new in the 21st century. But the previous problems have come against a backdrop of chairman Bill Kenwright going to the banks with a begging bowl to acquire funds for team strengthening. To see Everton toiling after huge investment is particularly frustrating for the supporters.You can see an in-depth feature on Everton's season on Soccer Saturday this weekend."
