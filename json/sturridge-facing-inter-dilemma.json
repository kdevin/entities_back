  "content": "Sevilla have been linked with a loan move for the striker, but Sky Sports News understands there has been no official approach from the Spanish side.\nMeanwhile, Inter are interested in a loan deal with an option to buy for the 28-year-old, and Liverpool will allow him to leave for Serie A if he is keen on the move.\nBut Liverpool are also happy to keep Sturridge at Anfield, given they are still involved in the Champions League and FA Cup and are trying to secure a top-four spot in the Premier League.\nThe most likely outcome appears to be that he will stay at Liverpool, unless Inter can agree a deal for the player and persuade him that his immediate future lies in Italy.\nSturridge has endured a frustrating season so far, making just 15 appearances, and, having picked up a thigh injury, he has not been in action since coming off the bench during the Champions League tie against Spartak Moscow in early December.\n",
