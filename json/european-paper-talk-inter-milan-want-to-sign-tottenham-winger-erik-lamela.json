  "description": "The January transfer window closes in under two weeks, which means the latest transfer rumours are much more likely to become a reality as Europe's biggest clubs look for the key signings to transform their season",
  "content": "Our friends at Football Whispers have scoured the European media to round-up the latest transfer news.\nInter Milan are planning for the long term. They're determined to bring Erik Lamela back to Italy and are prepared to wait until the summer to make the deal happen. Tottenham are already looking at replacements for the Argentine winger and have identified Malcom as the player to come in. (Calciomercato)\nBoth Tottenham and Liverpool tried to sign Javier Pastore but the Argentine playmaker turned down their advances, instead favouring a move to Inter Milan. (Gianluca Di Marzio)\nInter are also looking to bolster Luciano Spalletti's attacking options during the January window. The Serie A side have been offered the chance to sign one-time Liverpool transfer target Lucas Moura. However, it's Javier Pastore, Moura's team-mate, that the club are more interested in. Inter, sitting in third place right now, also want to bring in Angel Correa and Daniel Sturridge. (Gazzetta dello Sport)\nLille midfielder Yves Bissouma wants to join Inter. Though the 21-year-old isn't a top transfer target for Nerazzurri, he is on their list behind Javier Pastore and Wylan Cyprien of Nice. (Calciomercato)\nParis Saint-Germain are bemused by reports suggesting they would accept a cash-plus-Cristiano Ronaldo offer for Neymar. The owners of the Ligue 1 leaders want to build around the Brazilian star and it would be impossible to allow him to leave. (Marca)\nPhilippe Coutinho came off the bench to make his first appearance for Barcelona following on from his £140m move earlier on in the window. The La Liga leaders overcame a first-leg defeat to progress into the semi-final of the Copa del Rey thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Speaking afterwards, Coutinho was appreciative of the support he'd been given: \"It has been a special day because these were my first minutes with this club. I am very happy and excited, because of how the fans welcomed me.\" (Marca)\nBarcelona have added another player to their squad, this time to the B team. Montreal Impact youngster Ballou Jean-Yves Tabla has completed his move to Spain having impressed in the MLS. (AS)\nBorussia Dortmund have lined up Wissam Ben Yedder, once an apparent Arsenal transfer target, as their Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang replacement. The forward is looking to leave Sevilla this month after new manager Vincenzo Montella informed him that he would no longer be a guaranteed starter. (SportBild)\nChelsea left-back Baba Abdul Rahman has passed his medical with Schalke and his return to the club on loan should be confirmed imminently. There's no suggestion that his departure is tied to the Premier League club bringing in a replacement. (Kicker)\nOliver Bierhoff, the public relations manager for the German national team, is public enemy number one in Schalke after his recent comments. He sided with Leon Goretzka after the midfielder chose to move to Bayern Munich on a free transfer, saying: \"Any ambitious young international wants to win titles and sits in on Wednesdays on the couch when other Champions League play.\" (Kicker)\nParis Saint-Germain and Brazil winger Lucas Moura met with Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy in London on Thursday to discuss a move to Spurs, as Mauricio Pochettino looks to bolster his squad.
