  "content": "The former West Brom and Coventry forward died suddenly at the age of 59 on Sunday.\nEverton will hold a minute's applause when they host West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday but, so far, there are no other tributes planned by top-flight clubs for Regis, who was a pioneer for black players.\nIt is believed the league has yet to receive any requests from clubs but would not stand in the way of further tributes.\nViv Anderson, who was a friend of Regis and also the first black player to win a senior England cap, feels a league-wide effort would be deserved and that anything less would signify a \"small-minded\" mentality.\nThe former Nottingham Forest defender told the Daily Mail: \"I would personally like to see him receive a nationwide tribute, because of the ground-breaking impact he had on the game.\n\"His life and career should be properly recognised. I am bit disappointed that won't be the case.\n\"It seems small-minded. Cyrille led the way for many black players and he was taken so suddenly. He was still involved in the game, scouting and advising young talent.\"\nRegis, who played 297 times for West Brom in the 1970s and 80s, was the third black player to be capped by England.\nIn the 1978/79 season, he formed a famous alliance with Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson, who were nicknamed the Three Degrees by manager Ron Atkinson.\n",
