It feels to me like City, United and Chelsea are breaking away from Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham for pure economic reasons,\" Purslow told The Debate.\n\"United are what Jose was on about, you are talking Paul Pogba, the most desired footballer on the planet went there last summer.\n\"The most productive centre-forward in the Premier League, Romelu Lukaku, went there last summer.
