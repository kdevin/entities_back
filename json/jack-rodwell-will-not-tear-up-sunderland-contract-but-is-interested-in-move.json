  "description": "Jack Rodwell says he has no intention of ripping up his Sunderland contract and will only leave the club if a transfer can be arranged.",
  "content": "The midfielder, capped three times by England in 2011 and 2013, has not played in the Sky Bet Championship since September and has not made a senior appearance since Chris Coleman took charge at the Stadium of Light.Sunderland have, Sky Sports News understands, offered to rip up Rodwell's £70,000-a-week contract and allow him to leave the club for free.But the £10m signing from Manchester City in 2014 is not prepared to walk away from his future earnings and, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, said he is fit and raring to go if Coleman decides to include him in his first-team squad again.\"I'm training three times a day, I feel great. It's the fittest I've ever been, in a weird way, and that's without playing,\" Rodwell said.'It's the best condition I've been in for a long time and hopefully someone will reap the benefits of that. I've not spat my dummy out, I'm getting on with it, trying to turn the situation into a positive.\"This is my hardest spell here but there would be no use in me slacking off or huffing, I need to use this time to get ready for whatever is next. That excites me. I need a new challenge.\"I'm only 26. I feel like I've been in the game for a long time and people can't believe I'm still so young. I've been at Man City and won the league, I've played for England, I've had success and good times, just not enough for someone of my ability.\"Luckily, I'm young enough to change that. It's down to me now, no one else. My hunger is greater than ever, and that's out of pure frustration.\"I haven't put in a transfer request but I understand the club's stance and their position and, because of that, I understand it's beneficial for everyone if I move on. But it's not the fault of any footballer if a club decides to pay you a certain amount.\"",
