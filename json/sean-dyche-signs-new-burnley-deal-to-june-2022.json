  "content": "The 46-year-old has been rewarded after leading the Clarets to eighth in the Premier League and they are on course for their highest league finish in the modern era.\"I am quite young in management terms. I am still learning and still improving, I believe, so for my personal reasons, as well, I think it's the right place to be,\" said Dyche.\"I think we are still moving forwards as a club and that's important and also I'm aware of some of the challenges.\"It's an honest club, it's healthy and everyone is on the same page and I have really enjoyed that.\"I look around football and it's hard to find and it's hard to build. We've built it and found it, probably in equal measure, and I enjoy that side of it.\"There's lots of work to be done, but I'm definitely 'in' for the work to be done.\"Chairman Mike Garlick said: \"Hopefully it's the signing of the (January transfer) window, or certainly the extension of the window. I think it's a deal that suits the manager, it suits me as the chairman and the board and, most importantly, suits the club.\"One thing we have always wanted is a stable club, and Sean signing the contract today means we can build and plan for the future. I think if you can do that, you've got a far better chance of success. And - by the way - he has earned it.\"Dyche was appointed Burnley manager in 2012 and has twice led them to promotion to the Premier League, in 2014 and 2016. They stuck with the former Watford boss after being relegated and went straight back up as champions.They finished 16th in the top division last term, despite losing key players between both seasons. Dyche has seen the likes of Danny Ings, Kieran Trippier and Michael Keane depart during his time at the helm.This season Burnley have a record of won nine, drawn seven and lost eight from their 24 matches so far, beating Chelsea in the process, and Dyche was reportedly a candidate for the Everton job before they hired Sam Allardyce.",
