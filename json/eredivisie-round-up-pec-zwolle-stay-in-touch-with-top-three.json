  "description": "Youness Mokhtar's early strike clinched PEC Zwolle a 1-0 home win against NAC Breda and kept them in touch with the Eredivisie's top three.",
  "content": "Moroccan forward Mokhtar fired home a low shot from outside the area in the second minute and that was enough to see Zwolle bounce back to winning ways after last week's defeat at Den Haag.Zwolle remain fourth in the table, three points behind third-placed AZ Alkmaar.Vitesse Arnhem hopes of kick-starting their challenge for European football next season ended in frustration as they were held 1-1 at home by Heerenveen.Daniel Hoegh's own goal gave Vitesse a first-half lead, but Heerenveen hit back to level through Pelle van Amersfoort before the interval and only a brilliant late save from Remko Pasveer prevented the visitors from snatching victory.Johnatan Opoku's late equaliser rescued a point for VVV Venlo in a 1-1 draw at Den Haag.Bjorn Johnsen had given Den Haag a half-time lead, but midfielder Opoku fired home a low shot following a swift counter-attack in the 86th minute.Roda JC staved off a fourth straight league defeat as Dani Schahin's late equaliser clinched them a 1-1 home draw against FC Twente.Former Newcastle forward Haris Vuckic fired Twente into the lead early in the second half and although Schahin headed home in the 88th minute, Roda's winless league run was extended to five matches.",
