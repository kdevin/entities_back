  "description": "Mauricio Pochettino hailed the performance of Christian Eriksen after Tottenham closed the gap on the top four with a 2-0 win over Manchester United.",
  "content": "Tottenham's win puts them just two points off the top four - and six clear of neighbours Arsenal - ahead of a trip to Anfield to take on third-placed Liverpool on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.Eriksen was at the forefront of all that was good for Spurs at Wembley. He opened the scoring with the third-fastest Premier League goal of all time in under 11 seconds, and created chance after chance for his side. United couldn't cope with the in-form Denmark international, much to the delight of his manager.\"I think it was a great performance from Christian,\" Pochettino said. \"Christian is such an important player for us not because today he was great and he scored.\"But he's a player that links everyone and of course when he's not in the team we always miss him. He's a player that you miss on the pitch.\"I think the performance was fantastic and we played so well. The team deserved a lot of credit, a lot of credit.\"New signing Lucas Moura was paraded around Wembley at half-time as Pochettino's attacking options are bolstered following his deadline day arrival from Paris Saint-Germain."
