  "description": "Monaco fought back from two goals and a first-half red card to beat Lyon 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Sunday.",
  "content": "Rony Lopes' 88th-minute strike sealed the victory for Monaco, who as well as having Keita Balde sent off in the 44th minute lost Danijel Subasic and Radamel Falcao to injury.\nLyon had gone 2-0 up through efforts from Mariano in the 12th minute and Bertrand Traore in the 27th before Balde replied in the 31st, and Falcao then equalised five minutes later, tucking away the loose ball after his penalty had been parried by Anthony Lopes.\nBalde was subsequently dismissed having picked up two bookings in quick succession, the first for kicking the ball away and the second for a poor slide tackle on Ferland Mendy.\nFalcao came off due to an apparent thigh problem in the 55th minute, with goalkeeper Subasic having already departed early on after injuring himself trying to keep out Mariano's deflected strike.\nMonaco swap places with Lyon in the table, moving up from fourth to third. Leonardo Jardim's side are now two points above Bruno Genesio's, and one behind second-placed Marseille.\nThe score was also 3-2 as Caen beat fifth-placed Nantes in an absorbing encounter at the Stade Michel d'Ornano.\nYacine Bammou's strike put the visitors 1-0 up just after the half-hour mark, only for Ivan Santini to swiftly level with a penalty, and Damien Da Silva then gave Caen the lead seven minutes into the second half with a firm header.\nBammou fired in his second five minutes later, before Da Silva registered his own brace with what proved the winner, converting another header with 10 minutes of normal time remaining.\nSubstitute Yeni Ngbakoto netted a superb stoppage-time goal as Guingamp's losing streak came to an end with a 1-0 victory at Rennes.\nNgbakoto, a January signing from English Championship side QPR, opened his goalscoring account for his new club in delightful fashion, sending the ball over goalkeeper Tomas Koubek and in with his right foot from just outside the box in the second minute of time added on.\nThe result halted a run of four successive losses in all competitions for Guingamp, including their previous three Ligue 1 outings.\n",
