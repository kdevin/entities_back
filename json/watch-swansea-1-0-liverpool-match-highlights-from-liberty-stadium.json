  "description": "Swansea produced one of the shock results of the season as Virgil van Dijk's Premier League debut for Liverpool turned into a nightmare.",
  "content": "Alfie Mawson struck the 40th-minute winner for bottom club Swansea, pouncing on a poor Van Dijk clearance from a corner that Liverpool's #75million record signing possibly should not have conceded.Liverpool came into this contest unbeaten in 18 games and on a high after ending the unbeaten record of league leaders Manchester City, so few saw this 1-0 defeat coming.It was a frustrating night for Liverpool but they almost rescued a point in stoppage time when Roberto Firmino's header, from a Van Dijk cross, came back off a post.Jurgen Klopp's side dominated possession and territory throughout, but their usual invention and spark were badly missing, with 24-goal man Mohamed Salah suffering a rare off-night.Swansea remain bottom of the league - albeit on goal difference from West Brom - but it is now only one defeat in six games under new manager Carlos Carvalhal.Hit the video at top of the screen to watch highlights.",
