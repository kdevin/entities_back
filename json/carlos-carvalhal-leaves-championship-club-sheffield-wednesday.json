He is the best chairman I have ever worked with in my life in football and I hope everybody at Hillsborough can help him achieve the dream of the Premier League.\"Assistant manager Lee Bullen will take charge of the side for their Boxing Day trip to Nottingham Forest and until a permanent appointment is made.A club statement from chairman Dejphon Chansiri read: \"I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Carlos for the time, effort and commitment he has given Sheffield Wednesday over the last two and a half years.\"Both parties believe the time is right to go our separate ways. I maintain a huge amount of respect for Carlos as a coach and as a person and he will always be welcome at Hillsborough. I wish him every success in the future.\"During Saturday's loss at Hillsborough, some fans called for the manager to be axed, but the chairman jumped to Carvalhal's defence after the game and suggested his job was not under threat.Chansiri, who took over the club in 2015 and promised a return to the Premier League, said: \"Some people want to drive him out of our club, they cross the line with some abusive things they say.\"Now he is a very bad coach all of a sudden - maybe some people have short memories.\"",
