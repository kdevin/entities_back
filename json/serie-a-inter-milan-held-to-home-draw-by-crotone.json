  "content": "Eder had put the hosts in front after 23 minutes when he headed home from Marcelo Brozovic's cross.But Andrea Barberis levelled for the visitors on the hour mark, finishing from close range.It was a fair result overall as, though Inter bossed possession, Crotone actually created more chances on the night.A point keeps Inter in fourth place, one behind Lazio who face Genoa on Monday, while Crotone edge three points clear of the drop zone.Walter Mazzarri's Torino continue to prove hard to beat after forcing a 1-1 draw at Sampdoria that extended their unbeaten run to six games.Defensive midfielder Lucas Torreira fired Samp ahead in the 11th minute as his free-kick clattered off the wall and confused visiting goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu before bouncing into the net.Afriyie Acquah levelled before half-time, the Ghanaian smashing Iago Falque's assist beyond Emiliano Viviano with 25 minutes played. Acquah was later dismissed following a second bookable offence.",
