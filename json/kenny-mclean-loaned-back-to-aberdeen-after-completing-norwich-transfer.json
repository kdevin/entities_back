  "description": "Norwich City have completed the signing of Kenny McLean, with the midfielder returning to Aberdeen on loan until the end of the season.",
  "content": "McLean, 26, has joined Norwich on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee which Sky Sports News understands to be in the region of Â£200,000.McLean is the only outfield player to have been involved in each of Aberdeen's 29 games so far this season, scoring four goals and contributing two assists.The Scotland international said linking up with Canaries manager Daniel Farke was a major factor in his decision to move.\"Norwich has the right feel about it,\" McLean told Norwich's official website.\"I've met people at the club and it just seemed right that this was the place for me to come. And after watching them on the pitch, it just seems perfect for the style I want to play. The manager's philosophy suits me and the club is right for me at this time of my career.\"I think it's right for me to have a pre-season in the summer with the new team and with the manager. I'll need to adapt to the way he wants to play, and that takes time and doing that in pre-season is right for me.\"Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes said: \"When it became clear Kenny would be leaving the club, of course, we wanted him to remain with us until the end of the season, so this represents the best outcome for us.\"It's a fantastic move for Kenny, both in terms of his career and financially, and I am delighted for him as he has earned his move.\""
