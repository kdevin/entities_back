  "content": "But who is our resident expert tipping for victory? Read on to find out...Derby have been on an excellent run of form lately and will be brimming with confidence ahead of this game on Friday night. They're now in second place and favourites to get promoted behind Wolves, which proves what a fantastic job Gary Rowett has done so far.Bristol City, meanwhile, have lost five in a row and may have half an eye on their Carabao Cup semi-final second leg with Manchester City next week. They need to sort out their Championship form, though, as there are plenty of sides queuing up behind them waiting to take their spot in the play-offs. I can't see that happening on Friday night, however. Home win.Prutton predicts: 2-1 with Matej Vydra to score first (22/1 with Sky Bet)It's been a satisfying enough start for Jos Luhukay at Sheffield Wednesday. Obviously, a win in the Steel City derby would have been nice, but avoiding a defeat was far more important and they managed that, before following up with a comfortable win in their FA Cup replay in midweek.Cardiff are another tough challenge for the Owls. Neil Warnock's side got a great win against Sunderland last week to end their dismal run of defeats and will be hoping to kick on from here. I think this will be a good game with plenty of goals, but I can't split the sides.Prutton predicts: 2-2 with Jordan Rhodes to score first (70/1 with Sky Bet)Once again Aston Villa look red-hot contenders for promotion after three wins on the spin in the Sky Bet Championship. Their win against Nottingham Forest last week wasn't pretty by any means, but they got the result and they'll be looking for another three points on Saturday.Barnsley got a great draw with Wolves last week and are now unbeaten in four. But they're still hovering nervously just a few points above the relegation zone, and I can't see them picking up anything from Villa Park.Prutton predicts: 2-0 (11/2 with Sky Bet)It looks like Leeds are having another dip. It's been the story of their season so far, they keep getting a few good results in a row to get themselves into the top six then a few bad ones to drop right out of it.Millwall, however, are still the only side in the Championship without an away win all season, so Saturday represents a great opportunity for Leeds to get back to winning ways, although I can't imagine it will be pretty.Prutton predicts: 1-0 (11/2 with Sky Bet)Are Norwich still in play-off contention? They start the weekend in 13th in the table but are only six points off Sheffield United in sixth, meaning this is quite a big game at Carrow Road on Saturday.It just goes to show how well Sheffield United started the season that they've been on such a poor run lately but still find themselves in the play-offs. Norwich put in a big shift at Chelsea in the FA Cup on Wednesday night, though, and that could take its toll here.Prutton predicts: 0-1 (7/1 with Sky Bet)This is a real test for Middlesbrough. There are few tougher trips in the league for sides than one to Loftus Road, where QPR have seen off plenty of challengers so far this season.It's been far from the perfect start for Tony Pulis at Boro, with just one win from his three league games, and Ian Holloway will have his Hoops right up for this one. I'm plumping for a draw here.Prutton predicts: 1-1 (9/2 with Sky Bet)To think that these two sides were facing each other in the Premier League less than a year ago, and now they're fighting to avoid relegation to League One. It's remarkable how quickly things can go downhill.This is a massive six-pointer. Sunderland are bottom of the league, but just three points behind Hull in 20th and victory for Chris Coleman's side would drag the Tigers right into the heart of the battle. That being said, I think this will be a win for Nigel Adkins' men.Prutton predicts: 1-2 (17/2 with Sky Bet)It wasn't a great start for Aitor Karanka last week as Nottingham Forest fell at home to Aston Villa. They put in an incredibly dour performance, which was disappointing to see from them after such a fantastic win over Arsenal in the FA Cup the week before.It doesn't get any easier for Forest with a trip to Molineux on Saturday. Wolves have the best home record in the Championship and they're in a great position to keep that going. Home win.Prutton predicts: 2-1 (7/1 with Sky Bet)Northampton looked dead and buried a couple of weeks ago but have enjoyed two vital wins in a row to really give them a fighting chance of survival in League One.MK Dons are just a point ahead of the Cobblers and will likely find themselves in the relegation zone if they lose on Saturday, and I fancy a narrow home win.Prutton predicts: 1-0 (13/2 with Sky Bet)Notts County look relatively comfortable in the second automatic promotion spot in League Two right now, but there are plenty of sides lying in wait should they slip up.Exeter are one of them, and they would be right up there as well if they could find any kind of consistency. Lately they seem to follow up every win with a defeat and they can't build any momentum. Both sides will attack, and it should produce a good, high-scoring game.Prutton predicts: 3-2 (28/1 with Sky Bet)"
