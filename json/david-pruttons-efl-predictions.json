  "content": "But who is our resident expert tipping for victory? Read on to find out...Losing Gary Madine on Deadline Day was a massive blow for Bolton because he's been the difference for them on so many occasions this season. You wonder now whether they'll have the firepower to win games and stay in the Championship.Bristol City, meanwhile, got back to winning ways last week against QPR, which was very important for them as all their attentions are now on promotion. The table would suggest away win, but I think this will be a draw.Prutton predicts: 1-1 with Famara Diedhiou to score first (25/1 with Sky Bet)Now this should be an interesting game. Wolves got back to winning ways last weekend but still don't look at their fluent best, although they're still 11 points clear!Sheffield United will have a go, as they always do, and this should be an entertaining game at Molineux. It will be close, but I think Wolves will edge it.Prutton predicts: 2-1 with Leon Clarke to score first (70/1 with Sky Bet)That was a big result in midweek for Aston Villa. They had to hold on for long spells at Sheffield United but somehow managed to pop up with the winner very late on, and what a goal it was from Robert Snodgrass.Burton, meanwhile, would have been disappointed to lose at home to Reading, who had been struggling as well, and it's hard to see them getting anything from Villa Park. Comfortable home win.Prutton predicts: 3-0 (15/2 with Sky Bet)Derby are still in second but they've drawn a few too many games lately and have a few teams right on their coat-tails again, with Aston Villa, Cardiff and Bristol City all lurking.Brentford were dealt a huge blow in their play-off bid last week as they lost at home to Norwich, and will be desperate to get back to winning ways on Saturday. It will be a good game at Pride Park, but I just feel like Derby will edge it.Prutton predicts: 2-1 (8/1 with Sky Bet)Fulham are the form team in the Championship right now and they're showing no signs of slowing down in their pursuit of promotion. If they keep going the way they are then they'll be threatening the top two sooner or later as well.Nottingham Forest were dismantled by Preston in midweek and they look like they're lacking in confidence at the moment. Strange things can happen in this league but this is surely three points for Fulham.Prutton predicts: 2-0 (15/2 with Sky Bet)Leeds are officially in a slump again and Neil Warnock's Cardiff are one of the worst sides to play against when you're struggling.The Bluebirds are so tough to beat, they can grind you down and Gary Madine is a superb addition for them. This will be a gritty affair and I think Cardiff will prevail.Prutton predicts: 0-1 (6/1 with Sky Bet)Three goalless draws on the spin now for Sheffield Wednesday. Jos Luhukay has certainly shut up shop well at the back but they look a little bit too conservative and need to find their form going forwards.Birmingham got a massive win at Sunderland in midweek but this is the kind of game where Steve Cotterill would happily settle for a point. This could well be a fourth goalless draw in a row for the Owls.Prutton predicts: 0-0 (13/2 with Sky Bet)Sunderland are in a right bit of trouble now. They haven't been able to get the reinforcements in that Chris Coleman would have liked and you wonder where the goals and clean sheets are going to come from.Ipswich are bang in the middle of the table and this is the kind of game Sunderland need to get a result from if they're going to stay up, but I feel like it's going to be a draw.Prutton predicts: 1-1 (5/1 with Sky Bet)Bury will be frustrated that they've had to wait so long to play again after finally getting a couple of goals and a win at Oxford a couple of weeks ago. They're still in deep, deep trouble in League One but at least it provided them with a glimmer of hope.They face a Blackpool side who are on a terrible run of form and are sliding alarmingly down the table. It's a great opportunity for them but I think Gary Bowyer, who has done a great job in tough circumstances at Blackpool, will get his side back to winning ways.Prutton predicts: 1-2 (17/2 with Sky Bet)Forest Green got a great win against Cambridge a couple of weeks ago and it looked as though they'd turned a corner, but two defeats since on the spin have left them deep in trouble.They now face a Coventry side that are bang in form and high on confidence after their FA Cup exploits. But it's been a long couple of weeks for the Sky Blues and I think they'll get held on Saturday.Prutton predicts: 1-1 (5/1 with Sky Bet)",
