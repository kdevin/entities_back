  "description": "Fulham are interested in signing Southampton left-back Matt Targett on loan for the rest of the season, Sky Sports News understands.",
  "content": "However, no deal has yet been agreed between the clubs.Whites boss Slavisa Jokanovic wants another option at left-back as well as a centre-back and striker this month.But he said last week that his opinion on transfers was continuing to be overlooked by the club hierarchy and suggested the club sack him if they do not value his opinion.Targett, 22, is Saints' third-choice left-back behind Ryan Bertrand and Sam McQueen, with the latter making several appearances while Bertrand was injured in December.Targett has made just two appearances this season and the Saints are keen to get him out for more game-time.It was reported earlier in the window that Southampton were interested in a deal for Fulham left-back Ryan Sessegnon but Fulham do not intend to sell him this month.Second-choice left-back Rafa Soares, who moved to Craven Cottage on a season-long loan in the summer, has failed to make an impact."
