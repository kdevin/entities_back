  "content": "The 29-year-old is an international team-mate of Ahmed Hegazi, who has proved a big success in his first season at The Hawthorns after joining the club last summer.Gabr, who currently plays in his homeland for Zamalek, is being lined up to replace Jonny Evans if the centre-back leaves the Premier League club this month.Evans has been the subject of enquiries from Arsenal and Manchester City.Sky Sports News has been told Gabr, who has 12 international caps, could still make the move to England even if Evans stays at the club.Zamalek are reported to be open to a permanent or loan move, although a loan fee in the region of Â£750,000 for the rest of the season could potentially put West Brom off.Hegazi initially joined the club on loan from Al Ahly, but an option to convert that move into a permanent deal has since been exercised."
