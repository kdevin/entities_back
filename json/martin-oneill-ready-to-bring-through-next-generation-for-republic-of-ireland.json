  "content": "The 65-year-old had been among the candidates to succeed Mark Hughes as Stoke City boss prior to their appointment of Paul Lambert.After Ireland failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, O'Neill admitted he was considering his future despite having previously verbally agreed to a new deal.Glenn Whelan (34), John O'Shea (36), Wes Hoolahan (35), Daryl Murphy (34) and Jonathan Walters (34) are among a group of veteran players likely to consider international retirement and O'Neill is hoping some less experienced players are ready to assume a larger role.When asked about his decision to turn down Stoke to stay as Republic of Ireland manager, O'Neill told Sky Sports News: \"I am obviously pleased to do so. I had conversations with the FAI board. They wanted me to continue in the job and let's see how we progress.\"We have got a group of older players who have served the country brilliantly and we have a group of younger players who are trying to make their way at club level for a start.\"One or two of them have a bit of experience now with the qualification for the Euros and the disappointment of losing to Denmark in the playoffs for the World Cup.\"So with all of those things taken into consideration, I think the younger players should have that drive and determination to try and do something.\"I am staying, I am with the Republic of Ireland and I am delighted to be so.\"The Republic of Ireland were drawn with Wales and Denmark in Group 4 of League B in the UEFA Nations League.Denmark defeated the Republic of Ireland in the play-offs for the 2018 World Cup, after the Irish finished second behind Serbia in a group which also contained Wales so both opponents will have a familiar feel for O'Neill's side.\"Well, it is déjà vu for us. We beat Wales to qualify for the playoffs and then we have got Denmark who beat us in the playoffs and beat us convincingly in the second game,\" O'Neill said.Denmark thrashed the Republic of Ireland 5-1 in their World Cup play-off second leg in Dublin after a scoreless first leg in Copenhagen and O'Neill admits revenge will be on his mind when the sides meet again.O'Neill said: \"That is the way we look at it. We certainly want to try and avenge that if it is at all possible because it is still fresh in the memory.\"This is important. There is promotion and relegation and all of those things affect the possible placings eventually for qualifying for the European nations. I am totally in agreement with it.\"",
