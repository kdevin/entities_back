  "content": "City have lost 14 of their 20 meetings at Liverpool during the modern top-flight era, snatching their sole victory with a 2-1 win in May 2003 - when current City winger Leroy Sane was just seven years old.During that period, the Manchester club suffered their heaviest defeat against the Reds in October 1995 when Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler notched two apiece, while Jamie Redknapp and Neil Ruddock completed a 6-0 rout.In total, City have shipped 40 league goals at Anfield since 1992 and only scored 17, having lost each fixture since 2013/14 - despite ending each term with a superior league standing.This season, Pep Guardiola's side are undefeated and 15 points clear atop the table, with 20 wins from 22 games - scoring a league-high 64 goals and conceding a league-low 13.However, Guardiola will be confident his side can finally break the 15-year Anfield hoodoo following their 5-0 victory over Jurgen Klopp's men at the Etihad in September.That result was City's biggest winning margin over Liverpool, in all competitions, home or away, since winning by the same scoreline during WWII, at Anfield in October 1945.Will City break the Anfield hoodoo?
