He felt he wasn't going to be in the long-term plans and he decided to look elsewhere.\"I came in and he came into the squad and he was fantastic for us. He scored vital goals, stood up to big challenges and won big games for us.\"He decided he had an option that he worked really hard to get for himself and his family in a different place.\"We had a bit of a heart-to-heart and talked about his options. He knows what I think of him as a person and a player, but he's decided him and his family would benefit from a new challenge.\"I couldn't, hand on heart, stand in his way. I want the players to be happy and striving to make this place. Danny felt his heart was away from the place and I thought it was better for all concerned that he had the opportunity to go and explore that.\"The 26-year-old, who has five caps for Scotland, impressed in his debut campaign for Rangers and helped them secure the Scottish Premiership league title and League Cup double.After moving to Liverpool for £2m in 2010 he subsequently had loan spells with Blackpool and Bristol City before he returned to Scotland with Hearts, where he spent two and a half seasons.His second spell with Rangers saw Wilson win the SPFL Championship, play a further 87 times and score five goals.Murty, who replaced Pedro Caixinha, has made a number of January acquisitions including centre defender Russell Martin from Norwich on loan until the end of the season."
