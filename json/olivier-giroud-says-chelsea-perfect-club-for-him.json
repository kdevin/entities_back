  "content": "The France international signed an 18-month contract at Stamford Bridge and is particularly looking forward to playing a part in the Champions League last-16 clash with Barcelona.The 31-year-old was in the stands for the disappointing 3-0 loss to Bournemouth and could see plenty of action in the coming weeks, with Alvaro Morata sidelined by a back injury.Asked why he had been keen on the move, Giroud told the Chelsea website: \"The most important thing was talking with the coach (Antonio Conte).\"I felt like he really wanted me and he really wanted to work with me. I wanted to sign for Chelsea and nowhere else, I really wanted to play more.\"I wanted to stay in the Premier League, and Chelsea for me is perfect because I can even stay in London.\"But the first reason is the sporting challenge, that has always been my first priority. Everything is here for me to be happy.\"Giroud will be eligible for the two-legged Champions League tie against Barca, which starts on February 20, having scored three goals in six Europa League games for Arsenal this season.\"The Champions League is massive for a football player,\" said Giroud, who joined Arsenal in 2012. \"There is nothing above it when you're playing for a club.\"There will be two nice games against Barcelona. We know their qualities and I think everybody will need to be 100 per cent to go through.\"It will be very exciting and I'm looking forward to it.\"Get Sky Sports from Â£18 a month and watch the latest transfers live in action for their new teams."
