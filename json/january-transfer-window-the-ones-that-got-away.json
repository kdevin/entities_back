But ultimately he remains with the Foxes until the summer at least.Southampton were dealt a Deadline Day blow when they failed in their pursuit of Spartak Moscow winger Quincy Promes.Saints had hoped to complete a £30m transfer for the 2017 Footballer of the Year in Russia but Spartak were unable to find a replacement so blocked the move.Mauricio Pellegrino would have seen Promes - who has scored 15 goals in 25 games this season for the defending Russian champions - as a much-needed source of goals for his struggling side.Napoli appeared close to signing Everton's Davy Klaassen on loan with an option to buy - but the deal fell apart.
