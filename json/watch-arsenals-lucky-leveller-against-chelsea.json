  "content": "The Spain international left-back attempted to head the ball on target during the first half at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night, and saw his effort deflect off Marcos Alonso and Antonio Rudiger before beating the helpless Willy Caballero in the Chelsea goal.It was an excellent response from Arsenal, who had fallen behind a few minutes earlier in the second leg of the tie after Eden Hazard had fired home.The Gunners went on to win 2-1 on the night and by the same scoreline on aggregate to set up a final against Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday, February 25.Hit play on the video at the top of the page to see Antonio Rudiger's unfortunate own goal during the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg between Arsenal and Chelsea!"
