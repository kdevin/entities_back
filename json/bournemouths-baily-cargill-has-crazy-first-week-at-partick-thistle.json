  "description": "Baily Cargill has described his first days at Partick Thistle as \"crazy\" after playing against Celtic on the day he completed his loan deal from Bournemouth.",
  "content": "The 22-year-old centre-back joined Partick for the rest of the season and immediately got international clearance to face the Scottish champions just hours later.Cargill started the game, and although Partick lost 2-1, he enjoyed the experience.\"It's been a bit crazy,\" Cargill told Sky Sports News. \"I came up here on Sunday night, met the lads on Monday morning and then got thrown straight in on Tuesday.\"Sometimes I think it is better that way, going in a little bit blind means you don't get so many nerves. I think I did okay and I enjoyed it.\"My first taste of Scottish football was definitely different to what I've been used to. Celtic are obviously the best team in the league so that was quite a challenge.\"They came here and obviously had a lot of the ball, we didn't have much of the ball but I thought in the first half we were very good and we were unfortunate not to get a result.\"The England U20 international was given some reassuring advice before he left the south coast from Eddie Howe, who was behind Jack Wilshere's successful loan move from Arsenal to Bournemouth last year.Cargill added: \"He said just go and get games and gain more experience. Hopefully I can go back with a bit more confidence.\"The main aim of players that go on loan is to go back a better player so hopefully I can do the same as what Jack has done.\"He has obviously gone to Bournemouth and done really well and now he is back at Arsenal playing, and doing really well for himself.\"",
