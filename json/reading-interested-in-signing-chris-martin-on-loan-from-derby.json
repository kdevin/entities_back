  "content": "And a source has told Sky Sports News that Reading are one of the clubs interested in the 29-year-old forward.Martin has made only five Sky Bet Championship starts this season and will find himself one of five strikers at the Rams once Jerome's Â£1.5m deal from Norwich is over the line.David Nugent has been Gary Rowett's first choice at centre-forward, with Sheffield Wednesday loanee Sam Winnall recently deputising. Darren Bent remains at the club but has not made an appearance this season.Jerome is understood to be undergoing a medical with Derby on Tuesday.It could pave the way for the departure of Scotland international Martin, who was sent on loan to Fulham last season by former manager Nigel Pearson.Martin wanted to return to the club after Steve McClaren, under whom he thrived during the former England boss's first spell at Pride Park, returned but remained at Craven Cottage and helped the Whites reach the Championship play-offs."
