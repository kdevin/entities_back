  "title": "Benik Afobe: Wolves was my No 1 choice",
  "description": "If Benik Afobe was going to leave Bournemouth there was only one place he wanted to go.",
  "content": "\"There were Premier League options but as soon as I heard that Wolves wanted me this was my No 1 choice,\" he told Sky Sports.\"I've always wanted to come back and it will be great to hopefully help the boys get promotion. That's the aim.\"After two years of mixed success at Bournemouth Afobe finds himself back at Wolves on loan until the end of the season. It is, however, a very different club to the one he left.Wolves were 11th in the table when he left and six points off the playoffs. They currently find themselves 11 points clear at the top with a very different squad and seemingly destined for the Premier League. It's a move that Afobe hopes to make permanent, once he's started banging in the goals again.\"It's a loan right now and I'm just concentrating and focusing on doing well and scoring some goals,\" he said.\"Playing for Wolves in the Premier League has always been a dream for me, but we'll have to wait and see. I'm not trying to get ahead of myself, I'm concentrating on the next game and then the 16 after that. I just want to get back to the best Benik Afobe I know.\"Afobe needed little convincing to make the return to Molineux, but if his arm did need an extra little twist then his former team-mate Matt Doherty - who has benefited more than most from the new regime - was there to provide it.\"I've spoken to him every day since September and he's been telling me how great the manager is, how great the staff are and the new players that have come in,\" said Afobe. \"I've watched most of their games when they've been on Sky and I've kept tabs on the club. They've gone from strength to strength.\"The team has changed but it's still the same training ground and facilities. It's only been a couple of days so far but it's great to be back.\"Not that the deal was entirely straightforward. Afobe is only 24 but has spent plenty of time moving between clubs already. He was sent out on loan seven times by Arsenal before his permanent stints at Wolves then Bournemouth. Even with all that experience, however, it was a stressful switch.\"It was mentally draining,\" he said. \"I got advised to come up and then got told it wasn't happening about six times! It was a very late one, I was in the car and they told me I had 20 minutes to get to the training ground and get my stuff done, and it was the best news I've had in a very long time.\"I think it was at about 10.55pm and we just made the deadline. These things happen, though, and I've seen players before on Deadline Day hoping to get their dream move but it hasn't happened for one reason or another and they end up going back to their clubs.\"I'm lucky it happened for me and I've got a lot of people to thank for it. Hopefully I can repay them.\"Afobe's form for 12 months at Wolves was undoubtedly the most impressive of his career, netting 23 times and sealing his move to Bournemouth. He's fully aware, though, that success then doesn't mean goals now.\"When I was last here I was enjoying my football so hopefully I can continue where I left off,\" he said. \"I was really happy off the pitch and being in Wolverhampton as well, which is important for any player in the world.\"I don't regret going to Bournemouth because it was great for me. I made a lot of friends and improved my fitness and my tactical awareness. I'm one of those guys who think that things happen for a reason in life and I enjoyed my time there.\"It's obviously a confidence booster that you've done well for the club in the past and the fans already like you. But the past is the past and I'm starting from scratch now.\"First up for Afobe is a home game with Sheffield United on Saturday, which is live on Sky Sports Football and Main Event on Saturday evening.\"It's going to be tough,\" he said. \"They've been doing great until recently and they'll want to get back into the playoffs and go up.\"I know Leon Clarke well and he's scored a few this season, but we're concentrating on ourselves and we'll try to win the game in front of our fans.\"Don't miss the Sky Bet Championship clash between Wolves and Sheffield United on Saturday, live on Sky Sports Football and Main Event from 5.15pm",
