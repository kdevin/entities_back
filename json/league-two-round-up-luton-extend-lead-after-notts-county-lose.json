  "description": "Luton returned to winning ways to extend their lead at the top of Sky Bet League Two to six points after closest challengers Notts County were defeated by Exeter.",
  "content": "The Hatters were largely second best against Morecambe at Kenilworth Road. But Olly Lee's free-kick was headed home by Johnny Mullins in the 64th minute to hand Luton a 1-0 victory, which would have been savoured all the more after Exeter triumphed 2-1 at Notts County.Accrington remain third after rallying from two goals down to edge out Port Vale 3-2. Paris Cowan-Hall, Nathan Tyson and Craig Mackail-Smith scored as fifth-placed Wycombe clinched a tense 3-2 win over Crewe, whose goals came from Chris Porter's penalty and Harry McKirdy.Coventry are up to sixth after a goal in either half from Marc McNulty - the first from the penalty spot - plus one from Maxime Biamou sealed a 3-1 win over Swindon, whose effort from Ollie Banks proved mere consolation.Lincoln remain seventh after coming from behind to clinch a 1-1 draw at rock-bottom Barnet, playing for the first time under new head coach Graham Westley. Despite the point, Barnet are now six points adrift of safety after Kristian Dennis' last-gasp goal sealed a 2-1 win for Chesterfield at Yeovil.Forest Green remain in the bottom two despite coming from 2-1 down to beat Cambridge 5-2. Ten-man Mansfield twice hit back from a goal down before clinching a 3-2 win at home to Cheltenham, who had two men sent off in a fiery clash.Charles Vernam's opener was cancelled out by Sean Murray as Grimsby drew 1-1 at Colchester and Stevenage drew 0-0 with Carlisle.Newport beat Crawley 2-1 on Friday night."
