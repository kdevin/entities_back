  "description": "Roma have dropped Radja Nainggolan after he posted a video of himself on social media drinking and smoking while celebrating New Year.",
  "content": "The Belgium international apologised for the video which shows him with friends on News Year's Eve, but that has not spared him the punishment of missing Saturday's Serie A match at home to Atalanta.Roma head coach Eusebio Di Francesco opened his pre-match conference by saying: \"In line with the club's code of conduct, which I fully endorse and the player himself accepts, Radja Nainggolan will not be selected for tomorrow's game against Atalanta.\"This is a policy that applies across the board, should anyone from AS Roma or representing Roma make certain mistakes that are no longer acceptable.\"Anyone who is wrong in a similar fashion will be punished in the same way. These are the rules. Beyond this, the thoughts and opinions (of others) really don't interest me. I will just state again that Radja will not play tomorrow.\"Nainggolan, 29, has been one of Roma's leading players since moving to the club from Cagliari in 2014. He has made 121 appearances and scored 24 goals. He has also played 29 times for his country."
