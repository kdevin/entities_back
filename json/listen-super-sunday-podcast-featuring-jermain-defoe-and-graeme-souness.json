  "description": "Jermain Defoe and Graeme Souness give their thoughts on Southampton's 1-1 draw with Tottenham at St Mary's.",
  "content": "The Nissan Super Sunday game saw struggling Saints take a deserved lead through Davinson Sanchez's own goal, only for Harry Kane to equalise for the visitors just three minutes later with a close-range header.That goal took Kane to 99 in the Premier League, but neither he nor anyone else could find the winner in difficult conditions on the south coast as both sides settled for a point.Following the game, our two pundits discussed the performance of both sides, with an eye on man-of-the-match James Ward-Prowse while pondering on whether Spurs missed Christian Eriksen, who did not play because of illness.Listen to the podcast and subscribe to more via iTunes."
