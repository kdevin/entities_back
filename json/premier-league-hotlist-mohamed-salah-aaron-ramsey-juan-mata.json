West Ham were on the ropes when the strike flashed into the top corner, and it ensured there was no way back for the visitors.\nNot only did the Swansea captain get his team back on level terms with a vital second-half header at the King Power, but the former Argentina international central defender also turned in a rock-solid performance at the back throughout for the visitors.\nThe Spaniard pulled the strings in midfield for United, providing four key passes, two more than the entire Huddersfield side.\nHis cross for Lukaku's opener was superb, after a first half where United failed to gain any width in the final third Nemanja Matic was a close second in the man-of-the-match running, but Mata's class told at Old Trafford.\nA recent win over Brighton remains West Brom's solitary Premier League victory in their last 24 games, and the chief conspirator behind their latest downfall was Ward-Prowse.\nThe midfielder has been Southampton's stand-out performer during a disappointing season, and he will hope to grab the attention of England manager Gareth Southgate in the coming months.\nWard-Prowse has been directly involved in four goals in his last two away Premier League appearances (three goals, one assist), as many as in his previous 28 combined. His second-half free-kick proved decisive.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan came close to taking the honours after a fine all-around display, but Ramsey was the star of the show.\nHe got the ball rolling with the opening goal and then fired in to make it 3-0. He remained involved in the midfield throughout and confidently swept in to secure his first career hat-trick.\nCrystal Palace dominated the second half and can count themselves unlucky not to have taken all three points after coming from behind. Their main threat came from wide areas and the two full-backs - Timothy Fosu Mensah and Van Aanholt - were both outstanding as they provided a constant supply line to targetman Benteke. We've given the nod to Van Aanholt for producing the best pass of the match in the ninth minute, putting Benteke through and forcing a fine save from Darlow.\nThe mesmerising Egyptian took his tally for the Premier League season to 21 with two very different finishes. After being gifted the opener by a stray Dier back pass, his second was a thing of beauty. With Liverpool struggling for ideas as the game ticked into added time, he twisted between two markers with an imperious piece of skill and poked home. It reminded many - including his manager - of a certain Argentinean playing for Barcelona. At this rate, he's not too far off his level.\n",
