There were some quotes, going back a little while ago, concerning figures and communication between the two clubs.\"Categorically, there has not been any communication between the two clubs. He is just a name along with lots of other names.When asked if Brighton plan to make contact over Dembele in the future, he said: \"Pure speculation is probably the only way [to describe it]. If I talk about players the club might have an interest in, there would be numerous names. This is one name that has been consistently linked, there could be numerous others.\"We will continue to work as hard as we can on anyone we might want to bring in.\"Hughton also ruled out the possibility of defender Lewis Dunk leaving the club during the January transfer window amid newspaper reports linking the 26-year-old with a move to Liverpool.\"That would be a huge surprise to me,\" he said.\"Lewis has been magnificent for us, certainly during my period of time here.
