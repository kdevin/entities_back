He's a player of Athletic Bilbao.\n\"I didn't speak about previous players or talk about that in here so I will not do that. You will know if it happens, it happens, if it doesn't, it doesn't happen.\"\nCity wanted to sign the Frenchman when Guardiola first arrived at the club in 2016 but he turned down a move to the Etihad.\nAsked whether Laporte was a player of interest, Guardiola said: \"There were players in the past who we were interested in and we will be in the present and the future.\n\"I always try to do the best for the club; knowing the players that we have and knowing the players that can improve our squad.\"\nGuardiola did open up on the difficulty of completing transfer deals with City also interested in signing Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Fred, according to Sky sources.\n\"Here is not the place to talk about that [a potential move for Fred],\" said Guardiola. \"In terms of the club and both clubs, I don't want to talk about the players who are playing right now at other clubs.\n\"You know that to make the deals is so difficult today in terms of lawyers, managers, players' managers, the clubs, the money so that's why it's not the right place to talk about names or about what is going on inside of the clubs. I'm sorry.\"\nPremier League leaders City have spent nearly £400m under Guardiola but the Spaniard is relaxed about doing business this month.\nThe 47-year-old said: \"We are trying to do the best for the squad for now, for the next six months, for the next years.
