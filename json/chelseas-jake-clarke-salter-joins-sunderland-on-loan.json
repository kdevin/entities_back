  "content": "Clarke-Salter becomes Chris Coleman's first signing since taking over as manager at the Stadium of Light in November.The 20-year-old has been with Chelsea since 2006 but has only made a single Premier League appearance, coming off the bench against Aston Villa in March 2016.He had a spell on loan with Bristol Rovers last season before enjoying a superb summer when he was part of the England side that won the U20 World Cup in South Korea.After completing the loan deal to sign Clarke-Salter, Coleman said: \"Jake is a hugely talented young player who has jumped at the opportunity to come to this club and show people what he can do.\"You don't play for a club like Chelsea unless you have tremendous ability and I'm sure he will be able to demonstrate that for Sunderland.\"Jake is exactly the type of hungry young player I have spoken about and he has shown me just how keen he is to come to here and play in front of our supporters.\""
