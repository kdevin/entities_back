We need to make a good balance for the team, to give game time for all the players.\n\"We will see if some players can win some game time at other clubs but we have to discuss with these players.\"\nOne attacker who will not be leaving Leicester, according to the Frenchman, is Riyad Mahrez following reported interest from Liverpool and Arsenal.\nPuel, who previously said the Algerian could be worth £100m in the summer transfer window, reiterated that the winger is happy at the King Power Stadium.\nHe said: \"For Mahrez, there is nothing new to say about Riyad. It's always the same thing, always the same response.\n\"I'm happy with him, he's enjoying his football and he's enjoying playing with his team-mates - this is the most important thing.\n\"We can see his performance in games; he's a very good player and he likes his club and team-mates. It's a good feeling for him.\"\nRegarding potential incomings at Leicester, Puel said nothing was imminent but a deal could be struck if a player of interest became available.\n\"No, we are not close for the moment to signing other players,\" the 56-year-old said. \"I think we work normally in this transfer window and it's important to keep our focus about our transfer window.\n\"I think it's important to keep this squad because it's fantastic and it has a positive attitude.\n\"Of course if we can improve the squad we will sign a player but for the moment it's not like this.\"\n",
