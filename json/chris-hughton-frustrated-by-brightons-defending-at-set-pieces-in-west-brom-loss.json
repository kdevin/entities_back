  "title": "Chris Hughton frustrated by Brighton's defending at set-pieces in West Brom loss",
  "description": "Chris Hughton was left frustrated after Brighton conceded twice from corners in their 2-0 loss to West Brom in the Premier League.",
  "content": "Excluding penalties, Brighton have conceded 16 goals from set-pieces in the Premier League this season which is more than any other team in England's top flight.Jonny Evans and Craig Dawson both got on the scoresheet via corners which concerns Hughton as he says his team had been working especially hard on defending set-pieces in training.\"Hugely disappointing because I don't think there was a lot between the two teams,\" Hughton told Sky Sports after the defeat.\"We found it difficult defending set plays and corners and we've conceded goals [again]. We've worked as hard on defending set plays as we have done all season yet that's the difference between the two teams.\"The first goal really hurts us because you saw the crowd here today and they're buoyed by the fact they're 1-0 up.\"When they didn't get that second goal I thought we were right in it. On the balance of play, I don't think there was much difference between the two teams.\"The defeat leaves Brighton just three points above the relegation zone in 15th, and Hughton says there are two key areas his side need to work on ahead of their Premier League clash against Chelsea - live on Sky Sports Football - next weekend.He added: \"One, we've got to stop conceding corners that we are conceding and we have to be more productive in that final third.\"Some of that work to get there was good and we got into a lot of really good crossing positions but not productive enough in front of goal.\"We came here looking to win, we wanted to create through the thirds and we wanted to create opportunities. We are up against better opposition and that's proven tougher.\"Hughton also believes his side have shown a willingness to be competitive in every Premier League game they've played in this season.\"It's [the Premier League] new to them and the fact that we knew to expect this season to be a tough season.\"We've just got promoted and overall we've done OK. We've been in every game but Liverpool are perhaps the only team that have given us a real beating.\"",
