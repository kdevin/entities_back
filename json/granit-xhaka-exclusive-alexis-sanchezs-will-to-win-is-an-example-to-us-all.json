Alexis is an important player for us, he's got class which he shows every week, and I will be happy if he stays.\"If he stays or goes? I don't know what's going to happen. At training, he's always an example for many people because he always wants to win no matter what we are doing - a big game or a small game. I think that's something that characterises him.\"Xhaka may be welcoming another former Bundesliga player into the Arsenal midfield in the coming weeks if Mkhitaryan is to complete his transfer to the Emirates.Former Borussia Monchengladbach star Xhaka played against the Armenian while he was at Dortmund, and though he praised his qualities, remained tight-lipped on the potential of linking up with him.\"I only know him really from the Bundesliga and I've played against him a couple of times in the Premier League as well\" said Xhaka.\"He's an excellent player, with lots of qualities, but I can't really say much more to it because I am not really sure what's true and what's really happening.\"",
