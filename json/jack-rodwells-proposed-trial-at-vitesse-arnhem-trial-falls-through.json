  "description": "Sunderland midfielder Jack Rodwell's trial at Vitesse Arnhem is off for \"organisational reasons\", the Dutch club has announced.",
  "content": "The 26-year-old was due to start training with Vitesse on Thursday but the Eredivisie side revealed via its official Twitter account that he would no longer do so.They said: “Due to organisational reasons, Jack Rodwell’s trial with Vitesse does not take place.”Sunderland have told Rodwell they will tear up his £70,000-a-week contract if he can find another club, although the player has indicated he wants to be paid-up, despite having asked to leave.He joined the Black Cats in a £10million switch from Manchester City in August 2014 on a five-year deal, which did not include a 40 percent pay reduction clause when the club was relegated in 2017.Injuries and a lack of form have hampered him and he has made only 76 senior appearances for the club in his three-and-a-half years on Wearside."
