He is one of the best, I don't care what anybody says. That boy is one of the best goalkeepers I've seen.\"He's got the stature, he's got great kicking, and he made saves at Old Trafford that were great.\"He had no chance with the goals, absolutely none whatsoever. It's not just him who has conceded the goals, it's everywhere.\"He's only a young lad but he is definitely one of the best. Jack Butland in my opinion is one of the best around, without a doubt - not just in Britain, in Europe.\"Butland has conceded 43 goals in 20 Premier League games this season, meaning he is a part of the leakiest defence in the Premier League - a big reason for Stoke's current 18th place in the Premier League table.But when asked whether Butland could leave the club this month, Lambert replied: \"Absolutely no chance. As long as I'm here I'll do everything I can to keep him.\"",
