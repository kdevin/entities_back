  "description": "Theo Walcott is relishing the chance to play with Seamus Coleman at Everton and hopes the two can build a strong partnership.",
  "content": "Walcott scored his first goals for the club in Wednesday's 2-1 win over Leicester, which ended a run of seven matches without victory following his £20m move from Arsenal in January.Asked about linking up with Coleman, the former Arsenal forward said: \"Having him around is obviously fantastic. You can just see his work-rate up and down that right-hand side.\"He just shows he is at a completely different level when he comes back like that. He was up and down that wing, helping me out, talking and that is what it is all about.\"Seamus is a completely new animal and I really don't know how he gets that energy. I'm a so-called old-school winger, up and down and working hard for the team but that link-up play with Seamus was fantastic to see.\"Coleman was making his first appearance in 319 days after a double fracture of his leg on international duty last March.Manager Sam Allardyce was delighted with Coleman's impressive return, having played just over an hour for the U23s last week.\"For him to finish 90 minutes and, in the 92nd minute, run 80 yards with the ball was outstanding for me and an example to every player at this football club,\" said the Toffees boss.On the link-up down the right, he added: \"There is a new partnership flourishing, which has come together for the first time.\"Nothing more to say about it other than quality and understanding. Seamus has played against Theo quite a lot and there was that instant combination of the support for each other both ways.\"",
