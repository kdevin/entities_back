  "description": "Charlie Nicholas provides us with his predictions for this week's Carabao Cup semi-final first legs, live on Sky Sports Football.",
  "content": "Manchester City are odds-on favourites to lift the trophy but while the Soccer Saturday pundit expects Pep Guardiola's side to brush aside Bristol City, he predicts a more evenly-contested tie between London rivals Chelsea and Arsenal.Here are Charlie's predictions for the opening encounters...I'm afraid I don't give Bristol City any chance. They'll come and park the bus but I'm not sure how they can expect to execute that plan against the best attacking unit in Europe when they've conceded eight goals in their last two games against Aston Villa and Watford.Manchester City had little trouble breaking Burnley down and they're forced to play Sergio Aguero again because of Gabriel Jesus' injury, while Leroy Sane is scoring again and Raheem Sterling is in the form of his life.It is just a joy to watch Manchester City whenever you get the opportunity at the moment and this tie should be all-but over on Tuesday night.Pep Guardiola keeps telling us the quadruple isn't possible but I think it is and I think they're on course to win the first leg here.Charlie predicts: 3-0 and David Silva to score first (30/1 with Sky Bet)It was cracking 2-2 draw at the Emirates and Arsene Wenger has to pick a strong team here after making so many changes in the FA Cup, but so will Antonio Conte, which makes Chelsea favourites.Arsenal can have a day when the front three click and they're fantastic going forward, but they are broken defensively. They have been for a while and they don't know how to fix it, so Steve Bould must start making his voice heard.Arsene Wenger comes out and says we keep making the same mistakes and we all say, really? Is he finally starting to see the picture? His solution was a back three but that is still the same players with no idea how to defend.I don't see too much hope for Arsenal on Wednesday and I just hope they can nick a goal to keep the tie going.I could see Alvaro Morata making up for his missed chances and getting a brace here, while I can also see discipline issues for a Arsenal given they don't even seem to want to celebrate together when they're winning.Charlie predicts: 3-1 and Morata to score first (33/1 with Sky Bet)"
