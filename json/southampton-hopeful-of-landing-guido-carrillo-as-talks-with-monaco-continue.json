He has scored 20 goals in over 50 appearances for Monaco since signing from Estudiantes in 2015.Southampton, who are struggling in the Premier League and sit outside the relegation places by just a point, are seeking a target man to play alongside Charlie Austin when he returns from injury.Sky Sports News understands they also remain keen to sign Theo Walcott from Arsenal, but have not discussed potential moves for Atletico pair Nico Gaitan nor Kevin Gameiro, contrary to reports."
