  "description": "Two goals in three second-half minutes was enough for Ajax as they came out on top in a one-sided De Klassieker with a thrilling 2-0 victory over 10-man Feyenoord.",
  "content": "The hosts dominated throughout the match with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Joel Veltman and Lasse Schone going close in an incident-packed first half which also saw four cautions.\nAjax's constant pressure paid off after 50 minutes when Donny van de Deek broke the deadlock with a calm finish from a tight angle before Huntelaar powered a header home three minutes later.\nThings got worse for Feyenoord as they were reduced to 10 men when striker Nicolai Jorgensen received his second yellow card after 58 minutes before Ajax held on to ease to their fifth successive league victory.\nPSV scored a last-gasp winner to maintain their five-point lead at the top of the table following a 2-1 triumph at Heracles.\nSteven Bergwijn put the visitors in front with a close-range finish in first-half stoppage-time but Jeff Hardeveld equalised with a penalty after 66 minutes.\nHeracles continued to frustrate Phillip Cocu's side and looked set to earn a valuable point until captain Luuk de Jong converted Albert Gudmundsson's right-wing cross with the last kick of the match to steal victory.\nSparta Rotterdam suffered their seventh straight Eredivisie defeat at the hands of Excelsior, despite leading twice in the 3-2 loss.\nA Milan Massop own goal put the hosts into a third-minute lead but Ali Messaoud levelled just two minutes later for Excelsior.\nLoris Brogno scored from the penalty spot to regain the lead for Sparta, only for Messaoud to equalise on the stroke of half-time before Anouar Hadouir hit the winner four minutes from time.\nWillem II were held to a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Groningen at Konig Willem II Stadion.\nJapanese midfielder Ritsu Doan opened the scoring for the visitors after 14 minutes but Ismail Azzaoui ensured Willem II earned a share of the spoils as both sides edged further away from the relegation zone.\n",
