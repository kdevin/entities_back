You say: 'Oh, I got the lower ones because I don't like the ones at the top.'\"You like the ones at the top. They are so nice, so orange, so round, so full of juice but you cannot get there so you say: 'I don't want to go there' or 'I didn't like it, I prefer the other ones.' It reminds me of that story.\"He added: \"I know that if other clubs did not get him it's not a problem of money, for sure. That's not a problem of money.\"Sanchez could make his Manchester United debut on Friday against Yeovil in the fourth round of the FA Cup.Hit play on the video at the top of the page to watch Mourinho talk oranges and Sanchez",
