  "description": "Hearts have completed the loan signing of forward Steven Naismith from Norwich until the end of the season. ",
  "content": "Hearts pipped rivals Scottish rivals Rangers to the signature of former player Naismith, who was out of favour at Carrow Road.Naismith, who has been capped 45 times for Scotland, started his career with Kilmarnock before joining Rangers, and then played 103 times for Premier League side Everton.Jambos' boss Craig Levein said: \"It's a bit of a coup to bring somebody in of Steven's quality, not just in a footballing sense but as a person as well. It's much in keeping with the senior players we have here already, the likes of Don Cowie, Christophe Berra and Aaron Hughes.\"I think he'll be a huge player in the dressing room and a great example to the rest of the team. On top of that he's a fantastically talented football player.\"He'll bring a bit of nous, experience, energy and enthusiasm.\"The 31-year-old becomes the Jambos' second signing of the January transfer window following the acquisition of Demetri Mitchell from Manchester United."
