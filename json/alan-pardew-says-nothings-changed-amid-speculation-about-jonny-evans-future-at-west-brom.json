  "content": "Sky sources understand both Arsenal and City have enquired about Evans in the January transfer window, following the interest they both showed in the 30-year-old in the summer.\nBut when asked about the defender's future, Pardew said: \"Nothing has changed on that front.\n\"The only good news is he's fit, whereas he wasn't fit last weekend, so you can expect to see him on the team-sheet this weekend.\"\nPardew, who hasn't won in eight Premier League games since becoming West Brom manager, suggested he has a plan for Evans' potential departure, but insisted Arsenal's Calum Chambers wasn't part of it.\n\"That name's not entered into my thinking, or names at Arsenal or Manchester City or Manchester United if I'm honest,\" he added.\n\"When there is an offer on the table we will exercise our plan, if the offer is acceptable to us.\"\nWest Brom have only scored 16 goals in 22 Premier League games this season - the second lowest in the league - and Pardew confirmed he wants to strengthen his attacking options in the transfer market.\nHowever, he acknowledged he may have to sell before he buys in the window, explaining: \"The position at this football club financially is very, very tight.\n\"We might have to move a player out to bring players in. I'm saying we need to bring players in. We have to be on our guard for a bid of any player that might interest us.\"\nWest Brom take on Brighton on Saturday, but Pardew said that game will come far too soon for James Morrison and Nacer Chadli, who won't be available for \"another four or five weeks.\"\n",
