  "description": "Alexis Sanchez will be eligible to play in the Champions League if he completes his transfer to Manchester United.",
  "content": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan will also be available to play in the Europa League for Arsenal if the proposed swap deal between the two players is concluded.However, if Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was to also move to Arsenal this window, he would not be available to Arsene Wenger to play in the Europa League.Sanchez missed Arsenal's Premier League victory over Crystal Palace as he was travelling north to discuss his potential transfer to Manchester United, while Mkhitaryan will undergo a medical at Arsenal on Sunday with his move to the Gunners expected to be completed by Monday.Arsenal have also made an enquiry about Borussia Dortmund striker Aubameyang, according to the Bundesliga club.Despite Sanchez already playing in the Europa League for Arsenal this season, rules clear Sanchez to play in the Champions League as it is different to the competition the Gunners are currently a part of.The same rules, therefore, allow Mkhitaryan to compete in the Europa League for Arsenal, despite playing for Manchester United in the Champions League this season.UEFA rules state that new signings are unavailable if they have played in the same European competition for a different club, or if they have played for a club that are currently in the same European competition as their new club.This means that Dortmund's future involvement in the Europa League after finishing third in their Champions League group behind Tottenham and Real Madrid makes Aubameyang ineligible to play for any other club in the competition this season, despite the fact their first Europa League game is next month.Arsenal are currently sixth in the Premier League and struggling to keep in touch with the top four, meaning their best chance to qualify for the Champions League next season may be through a Europa League win, just as Manchester United did last term.Wenger's Arsenal will face FK Osterunds in the round of 32 in the Europa League, while Jose Mourinho's Manchester United have been drawn against Sevilla in the last 16 in the Champions League."
