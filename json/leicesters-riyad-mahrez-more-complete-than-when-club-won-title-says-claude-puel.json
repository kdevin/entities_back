  "content": "Mahrez, 26, scored his third goal in six games in Saturday's 2-0 win over Watford to lift the Foxes to seventh in the Premier League.\nThe winger - who asked to leave the Foxes last summer - has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Liverpool, this month.\nPuel, who has previously said Mahrez will not be leaving the club in January, believes the Algerian has improved since Leicester won the Premier League in 2015/16 and Mahrez was named the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year.\n\"Better? I think he's more complete, he can do more penetration, he is an experienced player and has good maturity,\" Puel said.\n\"When he can make penetration or play simple, it's good for him and the team.\n\"It was a different play [style], it was a direct play, long ball, and after with Jamie (Vardy) and Riyad they made the difference.\n\"He can make some penetration like one or two years ago but also he can organise the play with one or two touches and can give assists - he is more complete.\"\nSeven of Mahrez's nine goals this season have come since Puel was appointed in October, with the Frenchman guiding the Foxes out of a relegation battle and into European contention.\nPuel also praised Mahrez's professionalism and performances during the transfer window, despite continued speculation.\n\"We saw this on the pitch, he is enjoining his football and this is fantastic,\" Puel said.\n\"It's not problem for him and it's important he continues his work.\n\"After that, everything is just speculation. We know the transfer window is normal.\"\n",
