There's only going to be one choice. The manager has been great with the development of young players and it will benefit me.\"He [Brendan Rodgers] spoke to me on how he can develop me and players he has previously developed. He likes a core of players who are local.\"When I come here in the summer, I will have played over 100 games. It will be a bit of a challenge at first but it's a battle I relish, and it will bring out the best in me.\"Hopefully I can hit the ground running and if I do that then I will get a chance and the manager has proven that with other young players.\"Rodgers' squad go to Dubai for a training camp over the winter break and return to action on January 20 when they take on Brechin in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup."
