  "description": "Scottish Premiership football is back and there is a full set of fixtures for Sky Sports' football expert Andy Walker to cast his eyes over.",
  "content": "In the early kick-off, league leaders Celtic travel to Kilmarnock and the hosts will be looking for a repeat result of the reverse fixture earlier in the season when they earned a hard-fought 1-1 draw at Celtic Park. Hoops boss Brendan Rodgers has warned his players that he expects a patient battle against a side who were beaten 3-1 by Aberdeen in their previous game.Aberdeen host tenth-placed Hamilton Academical this weekend, having avoided defeat in all but one of their last six games and manager Derek McIness will be hoping his side can win and ensure they remain second. In contrast, Hamilton approach this game without a win in 2018, scoring just once since the turn of the New Year.Ross County travel to Dens Park in a bottom-of-the-table clash against Dundee, with both teams in need of a win. Ross County are stranded at the bottom of the league and sit six points adrift of Partick Thistle and Hamilton above them after failing to win since the start of November. Dundee's form has picked up in recent weeks - they have only lost one of their previous five games.Hearts were victorious over eighth-placed St Johnstone when they made the trip to Tynecastle in October, beating them 1-0, and they will be hoping to do the same on Saturday as they look to avoid going a third game without a win. St Johnstone will be hoping to replicate Monday's performance in the Scottish Cup which saw them ease past Albion 4-0 into the fifth round of the competition.Partick Thistle head to Motherwell five points behind their opponents, despite winning four of their last six games. Motherwell have struggled since making a strong start to the season - they have won just twice in their last 13 games. In the two earlier meetings between the two clubs this term, home advantage has proven fruitful.Rangers host Hibernian and it will be the first time Jason Cummings plays against his former side following his loan move from Nottingham Forest last month. Cummings scored eight times against Rangers while playing at Easter Road, so is it possible he could return to haunt his former side.Kilmarnock v Celtic - 12.30pm - SaturdayKilmarnock 0-3 CelticKey player - Moussa Dembele: Got his focus back after much transfer speculation, I expect more goals from him.Aberdeen v Hamilton Academical - 3pm - SaturdayAberdeen 2-0 HamiltonKey player - Scott McKenna: Might just win the goal of the season after that stunning strike against Kilmarnock.Dundee v Ross County - 3pm - SaturdayDundee 1-1 Ross CountyKey player - Liam Fontaine: Former Hibs man should give County a fighting chance of survival.Hearts v St Johnstone - 3pm - SaturdayHearts 1-0 St JohnstoneKey player - Kyle Lafferty: Leads the line so well for Craig Levein's men.Motherwell v Partick Thistle - 3pm - SaturdayMotherwell 1-1 Partick ThistleKey player - Trevor Carson: Needs to concentrate on doing the best he can for Motherwell.Rangers v Hibernian - 3pm - SaturdayRangers 2-1 HibernianKey player - James Tavernier: Arguably Rangers best player this season, plenty of assists and chips in with goals as well.",
