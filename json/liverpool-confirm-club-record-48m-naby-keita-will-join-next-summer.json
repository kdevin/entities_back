I have given my all every time I have worn the shirt - that will be the case until the final whistle, in my final appearance.\n\"Having my future resolved means I can now focus on helping RBL achieve great things this season. Until I join my new club, next summer, I will remain an interested supporter from a distance.\"\nLiverpool had put their pursuit of the 22-year-old on hold in July, having had two bids rejected by the Bundesliga club.\nA senior official at Leipzig told Sky Sports News that Keita would \"100 per cent not be sold in this window\", but a change in their stance has enabled Liverpool to strike a deal for 2018.\nLeipzig had been attempting to convince the Guinea international, who has appeared three times so far this season, to sign a new contract.\nKeita scored eight goals in 31 appearances last season as Leipzig finished as the runners-up in the Bundesliga.\nSky Sports News also understands Liverpool have made a £55.5m bid to Monaco for Thomas Lemar.
