I was playing in good teams but never won a title.\"This is something I'm really looking forward to, having the possibility to play in big games for big wins. Celtic is a club that is always going for the big wins.\"I've played in important games in Italy and Germany. I was in a cup final in Italy and we lost, unfortunately, but I hope I can add silverware to my career here.\"Compper, capped once for Germany in a 2-1 defeat to England in Berlin nine years ago, is the third player from his country to play for Celtic after Andreas Thom and Andreas Hinkel.He added: \"Celtic are a very big name, even in Germany. Everyone in Germany knows about the ambience in the stadium.\"It's seen as a football-crazy place. Celtic is a big name not only in Germany but worldwide. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world.\""
