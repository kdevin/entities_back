  "description": "Marvin Compper will join Celtic on January 1 after agreeing to move to the Scottish champions on a two and a half-year deal.",
  "content": "Having arrived in Scotland for talks on Tuesday, the RB Leipzig defender has agreed terms which will see him become part of Brendan Rodgers' squad when the transfer window opens.\nThe 32-year-old, who has previously played for Borussia Monchengladbach, Hoffenheim and Fiorentina, will be introduced to Celtic fans before Wednesday's home game with Partick.\nCompper told Celtic TV: \"When I first heard of Celtic's interest I was immediately very keen and eager to come.\n\"They are a club who play for titles and that is something which has been lacking throughout my career. I was playing in good teams but never won a title.\n\"This is something I'm really looking forward to, having the possibility to play in big games for big wins. Celtic is a club that is always going for the big wins.\n\"I've played in important games in Italy and Germany. I was in a cup final in Italy and we lost, unfortunately, but I hope I can add silverware to my career here.\"\nCompper, capped once for Germany in a 2-1 defeat to England in Berlin nine years ago, is the third player from his country to play for Celtic after Andreas Thom and Andreas Hinkel.\nHe added: \"Celtic are a very big name, even in Germany. Everyone in Germany knows about the ambience in the stadium.\n\"It's seen as a football-crazy place. Celtic is a big name not only in Germany but worldwide. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world.\"\n",
