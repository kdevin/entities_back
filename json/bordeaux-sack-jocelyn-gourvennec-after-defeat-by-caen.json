  "content": "Gourvennec has paid the price for only securing two wins in their last 13 games, with the final straw coming on Tuesday when they were beaten 2-0 by Caen.The club did manage a win over struggling Troyes last weekend but that was only their second since September 23.Gourvennec's departure comes with Bordeaux sitting 13th in Ligue 1, only three points off Toulouse who sit in 19th and two points outside the relegation zone.He has also had to deal with constant talk about the future of star player Malcom, who has been linked with a move to the Premier League with either Arsenal or Liverpool.Gourvennec had been in the role since 2016, having taken over following four years with Guingamp.Assistant Eric Bedouet has been placed in temporary charge of first-team affairs.",
