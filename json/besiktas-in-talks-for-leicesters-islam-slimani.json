  "content": "The Besiktas president, Fikret Orman, was at King Power Stadium on Tuesday night to see Slimani play against Fleetwood in the FA Cup.Talks with the Turkish club regarding the potential sale of the player are ongoing, though Leicester are yet to comment on the unfolding situation.Slimani became Leicester's club-record signing after arriving at the King Power for Â£28m following the title-winning season of 2015/16.Despite being with the Foxes for little over 18 months, Slimani could be allowed to leave after manager Claude Puel admitted he has too many strikers at the club.Leicester are prepared to listen to offers for all of their front men, except Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki.The Foxes, however, will not sell the Algerian international on the cheap, and he remains part of club plans for the remainder of the season.Slimani has made 17 appearances for Leicester so far during the current campaign, though has only started one Premier League game since September. In all competitions, the 29-year-old has come up with five goals and one assist.Leonardo Ulloa is another player that Leicester are prepared to let go, if the deal is right.Sky sources understand Aston Villa have made an approach to take him on loan, but a number of other clubs are also interested in the Argentine."
