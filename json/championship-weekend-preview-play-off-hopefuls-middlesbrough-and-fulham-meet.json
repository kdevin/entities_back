  "content": "Boro, eighth, and Fulham, 10th are both within touching distance of the top six heading into the weekend, and Tony Pulis is wary of the challenge of Slavisa Jokanovic's side.\"They've got a manager who's been there for three years so he's put in place what he wants, what he thinks will be successful and what he thinks will take Fulham out of the Championship,\" Pulis said. \"They play some very attractive football and they work very hard for one another.\"This will be one of the big tests, and we need everyone turning out together, as well as the supporters getting behind the team because we need them.\"Elsewhere, runaway leaders Wolves travel to Barnsley. Nuno Espirito Santo's side are 12 points clear of Derby in second, while the Rams visit Birmingham.Should Derby slip up then both Cardiff and Bristol City, who are two points behind, will hope to capitalise. The Welsh club host Sunderland, live on Sky Sports Football from midday on Saturday, and the Robins welcome Norwich to Ashton Gate. The other live game this weekend sees two European champions meet at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest host Aston Villa on Saturday evening.Burton, the other club in the bottom three alongside Birmingham and Sunderland, will hope to climb out of the drop zone when they welcome QPR to the Pirelli Stadium, while Hull and Bolton, who could both drop into the bottom three if results go against them, host Reading and travel to Brentford respectively.Saturday also sees Ipswich meet Leeds at Portman Road and Preston head to Millwall."
