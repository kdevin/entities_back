  "description": "Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp does not expect to see the best of club-record signing Virgil van Dijk until after the summer and admitting the defender was not \"match fit\" when he first arrived at Anfield.",
  "content": "Van Dijk became the most expensive defender in history when he joined Liverpool from Southampton for Â£75m in January.The 26-year-old scored on his debut for the club against Everton in the FA Cup but could not prevent Liverpool from suffering back-to-back defeats to Swansea and West Brom, and he was subsequently rested by Klopp for the 3-0 win over Huddersfield on Tuesday.Klopp has urged Liverpool supporters to remain patient with Van Dijk and expects the Netherlands international to improve as the season progresses.\"I'm very happy with him but there will always be ups and downs,\" said Klopp. \"We will see the best from Van Dijk after the summer. We don't have the time to wait until then, why should we?\"He can bring a lot of things in already and that is good. We have had a lot of talks, it is quite difficult, our defending is different to Southampton. He has to get used to it.\"Klopp admitted Van Dijk was struggling for full fitness after arriving from Southampton.\"When Virgil came here he wasn't match fit, that is the truth,\" said Klopp.\"He had a long injury, then he played, then he was injured. Then the transfer was an open case and he didn't play for Southampton, so it wasn't a consistent season.\"I haven't known him long enough to say 'yes you can play all the games in this moment'. He expected it, he is still a new player.\"More to follow..."
