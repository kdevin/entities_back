We don't have the time to wait until then, why should we?\"He can bring a lot of things in already and that is good. We have had a lot of talks, it is quite difficult, our defending is different to Southampton. He has to get used to it.\"Klopp admitted Van Dijk was struggling for full fitness after arriving from Southampton.\"When Virgil came here he wasn't match fit, that is the truth,\" said Klopp.\"He had a long injury, then he played, then he was injured. Then the transfer was an open case and he didn't play for Southampton, so it wasn't a consistent season.\"I haven't known him long enough to say 'yes you can play all the games in this moment'. He expected it, he is still a new player.\"More to follow...",
