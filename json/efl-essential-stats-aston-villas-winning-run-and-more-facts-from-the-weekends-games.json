  "content": "There were seven red cards in the Championship on Saturday - the most on a single day for almost exactly six years, when the same number of reds were shown on February 4, 2012. Four of the seven shown on Saturday came in the first half.\nAston Villa's 3-2 win over Burton Albion at Villa Park means they've now won their last six league games - their best run for 28 years, when they clinched seven straight victories between December 1989 and February 1990 in the old Division One under Graham Taylor. Villa finished runner's up to Liverpool that season.\nThe win over Burton was Steve Bruce's sixth in seven meetings with Nigel Clough. Burton have now conceded 15 goals in their last four league games having only conceded 12 in their previous 11. Robert Snodgrass has either scored or assisted in his last six Championship League games - scoring six goals and providing three assists.\nDerby remain second in the Championship after their 3-0 home win against Brentford. They are unbeaten in their last 11 League games, winning seven and drawing four and only conceding two goals in the process.\nIt's Derby's best unbeaten League run since they went 20 Division One games unbeaten under Jim Smith in 1995-96. No other side from England's top four divisions is on a longer unbeaten run.\nWolves are currently 11 points clear at the top of the Championship with 68 points, meaning they have 33 points more than at the same stage of last season, when they lay 18th on 35 points.\nThey've already won 10 more points than their total for the whole of last season (58). Wolves have won 21 league games this season - only Manchester City have won more in England's top four divisions (22).\nRuben Neves, Wolves' record signing at £15.8m, has scored all four of his goals for them from outside the box.\nBirmingham jumped up to 19th in the table with their 3-1 win at Sheffield Wednesday. The Blues have won four of their last six Championship games having only won four of their previous 24. Jota scored his first goals for Birmingham in his 18th appearance for the club.\nBirmingham have scored three goals in each of their last two games, the first time they've scored three or more goals in successive league games for two years. Birmingham had scored only six goals in their previous nine games.\nWigan remain two points clear at the top of League One after their 2-0 win against Gillingham. Like Derby, they are 11 games unbeaten, however Wigan have picked up two points more than the Championship side in this period.\nThis is Wigan's best unbeaten run since a run of 20 games two seasons ago propelled them to promotion to the Championship. Will Grigg has now scored 12 goals in his last 15 appearances. The Latics ended Gillingham's eight-game unbeaten run.\nWycombe remain second in League Two after their 4-3 win over Carlisle at Adams Park. Despite being down to 10 men for the majority of the second half, they managed to score two goals in injury-time with the winner coming in the 96th minute.\nThey currently sit second in League Two which is their highest League position since October 2015. The Chairboys have won their last five league games, only the second time in the last 11 years that they've won five or more successive League games.\n",
