  "content": "Yuri Berchiche opened the scoring for PSG in first-half stoppage time before Neymar put the game out of reach after 77 minutes with a free-kick into the top corner from 19 yards.Giovani Lo Celso added a third in the closing stages to complete a fine win for Unai Emery's side, who had to wait until virtually the final kick of the opening half before taking the lead.Lille failed to deal with Edinson Cavani's cross and Berchiche was there to finish with a low shot.Neymar, an injury doubt for Saturday's match, then scored his 18th Ligue 1 goal of the season with an unstoppable free-kick from a central position before Lo Celso completed the rout with a delightful chip with just three minutes remaining.Montpellier moved up to sixth in the table after recovering from a goal down to beat Angers 2-1.Karl Toko Ekambi put the visitors in front from the penalty spot after 20 minutes, but Paul Bastien-Lasne equalised just before the interval and Isaac Mbenza grabbed what proved to be the winner on 71 minutes.Away teams otherwise enjoyed a successful evening with Max Gradel's 67th-minute goal giving Toulouse a 1-0 win at Nice, and St Etienne and Bordeaux both recording 2-0 wins on the road.Mathieu Debuchy, who moved from Premier League side Arsenal on Deadline Day after a frustrating spell in London, put St Etienne in front at Amiens after 62 minutes.And another player who enjoyed an unsuccessful spell in England, former Newcastle United midfielder Remy Cabella, sealed the win five minutes from time.Bordeaux continued to climb up the table thanks to a third win in succession, with Younousse Sankhare putting the visitors ahead at Strasbourg after just three minutes. Gaetan Laborde doubled their lead early in the second half.",
