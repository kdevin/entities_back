  "description": "Manchester City are admirers of Harry Maguire, Sky Sports News understands, but they do not consider the Leicester centre-back a target for January.",
  "content": "The runaway Premier League leaders are actively trying to sign a new centre-back this month and want either West Brom's Jonny Evans or Real Sociedad defender Inigo Martinez.Maguire joined Leicester from Hull in the summer for a fee of £17million but it is likely to take closer to £50m to prise him away from the King Power Stadium, with the player having broken into the England squad.Evans, whose West Brom contract expires in 2019, and Martinez present more affordable options but their pursuits are not without their own challenges.Albion boss Alan Pardew wants to keep Evans and said at that they would wait to see if a club made a bid for Evans before deciding on his future, but he is also a target for Arsenal.However, Pardew, whose team are in the bottom-three and four points adrift of safety, has also admitted he is planning for a potential replacement.City's other target Martinez is a 26-year-old Spain international with four caps. He is left footed and has played once at left-back for the La Liga club this term.",
