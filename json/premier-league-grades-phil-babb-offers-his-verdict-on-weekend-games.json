  "content": "We asked Sky Sports News guest Phil Babb to offer his verdict on the weekend's top-flight action, with the former Liverpool defender grading each club on their display.\nSo, how did YOUR club fare - did they top the class with an A+, does an F show there's room for improvement or are they somewhere in between? Read on to find out...\nArsenal's start against Everton was breathtaking. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan both shone on their debut and the Gunners could have asked for much more.\nBournemouth have had a good week with a couple of good results and it's important for them to beat a team around them.\nAfter a run of bad results, Brighton's win over West Ham was important. To score three goals, two of them great goals, against a rival at the bottom of the table would have filled them with confidence for the remainder of the season.\nBurnley have been fantastic at home this season and to show the tenacity to come from a goal down against the champions-elect was great.\nCarlos Carvalhal has got two great results against Liverpool and Arsenal and his revolution went on with a decent point on the road. No one foresaw him turning things around the way he has at Swansea, fair play to him, he is working wonders.\nI was going to mark Liverpool down but I've given them an A because they were playing against a very talented Spurs side. They should have won the game, having certainly won the first half.\nIt was a good home performance from United. It was a great home debut for Alexis Sanchez, scoring a goal in a routine display from Jose Mourinho's side.\nTo score three goals away from home and get three points is an achievement, but to do it against a fellow side at the bottom of the table makes it even better.\nSpurs won the second half of their epic clash at Anfield and deserve an A for their performance. They played their part in a fantastic game that was a credit to the Premier League.\nI've given Huddersfield a fairly high mark despite them losing. To go to Old Trafford and keep it just to two goals was credible.\nPalace have been struggling but they've got great attacking players and they should have put Newcastle to bed. They couldn't do that so after earning a point at home I've given them a B.\nLeicester have got more about them, particularly at home, and they should have got more out of the game against Swansea, who may be re-energised but are still struggling. The Riyad Mahrez saga may have had an impact on Leicester, after all, he is key to them.\nCity were under-par compared to their usually high standards. They missed a couple of sitters, notably Raheem Sterling's glaring miss, so I've got to mark them down.\nTheir game at Selhurst Park could have gone either way. They took the lead early and withstood a lot of pressure to earn a credible point on the road.\nPaul Lambert would have wanted a better showing from his side. They could have made more of a fight of it on what was an average showing on the south coast.\nI fancied West Brom to get something at home to a side that are struggling but they just didn't do enough. It was a good game with five goals but West Brom were disappointing.\nIt proved to be another average performance from West Ham. Man for man they have a better team and squad than Brighton and they should have got something out of the game.\nI haven't even marked Everton, they are ungraded. They were really, really bad. You don't expect a Premier League side to capitulate in the first 20 minutes like they did.\n",
