  "content": "After a week's break, Premier League action returns this weekend and it all gets underway at 3pm on Saturday with six games taking place before Tottenham host Everton at 5.30pm.Nissan Super Sunday also serves up two tasty treats, with Bournemouth v Arsenal at 1.30pm before Liverpool host Manchester City at 4pm. It is all rounded off on Monday Night Football as managerless Stoke travel to Manchester United.Ahead of the games, we take a look at some of the talking points...The transfer window is in full swing and Riyad Mahrez is once again the subject to much speculation, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea being linked with the Algerian, and his current side Leicester travel to the latter this weekend.The trip could see Mahrez in a Leicester shirt for the last time if a move does materialise, with the Foxes looking to build on their 3-0 win against Huddersfield last time out in the league after four games without a win.However, Leicester have won just once in their 11 previous Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge (W1 D3 L7) and Chelsea having won each of their last seven home games in the top flight.After a storming start to the Premier League season, Burnley are having a touch of bad form, failing to win any of their last five games in the competition, although this has included three draws.This weekend, they travel to a Crystal Palace side rejuvenated under Roy Hodgson, but the Clarets will fancy themselves to take three points, having won each of their last three Premier League games against the south Londoners - they've only beaten Hull in four consecutive meetings in the competition before.But Crystal Palace are unlikely to let the game pass them by without a fight, with only Arsenal and Everton (12) having gained more points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than the Eagles (11).Under David Moyes, Marko Arnautovic seems to be finding the form that convinced West Ham to fork out Â£20m for him in the summer, having scored in his last two Premier League away games against Stoke and Bournemouth.Only five players have ever scored in three or more consecutive games on the road for West Ham in the competition, most recently Diafra Sakho in October 2014, and Arnautovic could join that list on Saturday.Huddersfield are winless in their last four Premier League outings and West Ham won the reverse fixture 2-0 back in September, although they've never won both league games against the Terriers in any of the previous 15 seasons they have met.The new manager uplift kicked in almost instantly for Swansea in their last Premier League away game, with Carlos Carvalhal overseeing a 2-1 win against Watford, although he did go on to lose the following game at home to Tottenham.But they will be hoping for another away victory when they visit Newcastle on Saturday, having last won back-to-back away games in the Premier League in January 2017 against Crystal Palace and Liverpool.The Magpies have just hit a good patch of form though, having won seven points from their last 12 available in the top flight (W2 D1 L1), after a run that saw them pick up just one point from a possible 27. They also beat Luton 3-1 in the FA Cup on Saturday.Southampton currently sit just above the relegation places on goal difference, only thanks to Stoke having the worst in the league at the moment. But the Saints will be looking to pull away from the drop zone when they take on Watford on Saturday, despite being winless in their last nine Premier League games.However, their opponents are also in a sticky spot with their recent form, having lost six of their last seven Premier League games and dropped 16 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season - more than any other side.More good news for Southampton fans is Watford's only home Premier League victory against the Saints came in their very first such meeting - winning 3-2 back in December 1999 - while Southampton have not lost both league meetings against the Hornets in a season since the 2007-08 Championship campaign after being beaten 2-0 in September.It has been 20 games since West Brom last won in the Premier League, a run that stretches back to August 19 when they beat Burnley 1-0. It has also seen a change of manager, although Alan Pardew has only found the winning touch in the FA Cup so far after the Baggies' 2-0 win at Exeter on Saturday.But they will face an entirely different task when the league action returns on Saturday, although they will be up against a Brighton side who have failed to win any of their last three top-flight games, although the Seagulls did win the return fixture 3-1 in September.However, the Baggies have never lost a home league match against Brighton (W5 D4), in a run stretching between 1979 and 1993 with each of the last three league meetings between these sides ending in a 3-1 home win.Harry Kane continues to smash barriers. He beat Alan Shearer's previously held record (36) for the number of Premier League goals scored in a calendar year in 2017 - netting 39 times - and there is another landmark in his sights this weekend.Kane is just one goal away from equalling Teddy Sheringham (97) as Tottenham's highest scorer in the Premier League, with the England striker currently on 96, and has scored twice in each of his last two Premier League appearances against Everton.The reading gets slightly harder for Toffees fans too, having failed to win away in the league at Spurs since November 2008, drawing three and losing five since then, with each of their last three visits to Wembley Stadium ending in 2-1 defeats.The Gunners are back on Sky Sports this weekend to kick off Nissan Super Sunday, and will be hoping for a victory, having drawn their last two Premier League games and not doing so in three consecutive matches since September 2014.However, Bournemouth have not won any of their six games in all competitions against Arsenal (D1 L5), conceding at least twice in every match and lost 3-0 in the reverse fixture in September.Last season's fixture at the Vitality Stadium was a cracker though, with Arsenal coming from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with Bournemouth, which is the only time they've ever come back from such a deficit in the Premier League.After months of speculation, Philippe Coutinho has finally departed for Barcelona in world football's second biggest transfer, with the post-'Little Magician' era starting at Liverpool live on Nissan Super Sunday.The Reds had been without the Brazilian for the last two games - both 2-1 wins in the Premier League and FA Cup - although they will face an entirely different test against the unbeaten league leaders at Anfield this weekend.Manchester City are still unbeaten in domestic football this season, cruising past Burnley in the FA Cup on Saturday before beating Bristol City in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final in midweek, although Liverpool will also want to maintain their 17-game unbeaten run in all competitions.Stoke have had a tough few months, with a 2-1 defeat to Coventry in the FA Cup on Saturday proving to be the final straw for the Potters' hierarchy as Mark Hughes was given his marching orders.Eddie Niedzwiecki will be the man to lead Stoke in their Monday Night Football clash with Manchester United, and a fourth successive Premier League draw against Jose Mourinho's side would surely be seen as a good result for the managerless Potters.They held United to a 2-2 draw at the Bet365 in September 2017, and Mourinho's men have also taken only a point in each of three of their last four Premier League games."
