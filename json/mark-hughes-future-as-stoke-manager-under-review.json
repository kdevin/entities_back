  "content": "The club are now two places and two points above the relegation zone, and there was a chorus of boos, together with some placards and chants of \"Hughes out\" from Stoke supporters at the final whistle of their 1-0 defeat to Newcastle on New Year's Day.Stoke's owners and bosses have become increasingly concerned by the poor results, but they are reluctant to change their manager mid-season.In the 11 years since Peter and John Coates bought the club for a second time, they have only sacked one manager, Tony Pulis, in the summer of 2013.Sky Sports News has been told the Coates family, together with chief executive Tony Scholes, are concerned at a perceived lack of quality replacements, should they decide to dismiss Hughes.They would prefer a British or Irish manager in charge of the club, and they are very aware of the problems Everton had in taking over five weeks to appoint Sam Allardyce as a replacement for Ronald Koeman.Hughes stormed out of his post-match press conference following the defeat to Newcastle, and when asked about the threat to his position as manager, replied: \"Who else is going to do it?\"",
