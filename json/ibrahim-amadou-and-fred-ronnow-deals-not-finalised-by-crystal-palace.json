  "description": "Crystal Palace were unable to force through Deadline Day moves for Ibrahim Amadou and Fred Ronnow.",
  "content": "Palace had hoped to add Lille midfielder Amadou and Brondby goalkeeper Ronnow but, as the window shut, their only finalised deal was for FC Midtjylland striker Alexander Sorloth.The deal to sign Amadou was particularly tough, with the player having travelled by train to London to complete a move, which would have been a £2m loan with an option to buy for a further £14m.Sky Sports News understands that Amadou pleaded with the French club to allow him his dream Premier League move and was left mortified when he was told it would not be happening.That deal was dependent on Lille also being able to recall Xeka from loan at Dijon, who did not release the player.Palace were also looking for additional depth at goalkeeper, and put a transfer sheet in for the 25-year-old, capped five times by Denmark.But Brondby were in a similar boat to Lille, needing to find a replacement for Ronnow before allowing him to join Palace, which again they were unable to manage."
