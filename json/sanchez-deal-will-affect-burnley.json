Where's the next valuation on one of our players or one of our targets?\"Sky Sports News understands Manchester United are prepared to pay Sanchez more than £350,000 per week, but Dyche admitted Burnley are still some way off being able to offer six-figure weekly wages.\"It will be a while I think,\" he said. \"Our chairman certainly backs our team the best the board feel we can. We're quite a long way off that but the numbers have jumped the last couple of years, so who knows?\"Burnley will be without Jon Walters for the United game and the next six to eight weeks after he had minor knee surgery to trim a cartilage.Stephen Ward and Chris Wood will also not be fit in time for Saturday's match, but Scott Arfield and Charlie Taylor will be in contention, Dyche confirmed.",
