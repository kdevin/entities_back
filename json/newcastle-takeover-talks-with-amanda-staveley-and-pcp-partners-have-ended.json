A relegation compensation clause was understood to be a sticking point at one stage in negotiations.Magpies manager Rafa Benitez had expressed concern that the talks were hampering his attempts to strengthen his squad in January, stating he did not know what funds he had to work with.Sky Sports News reported earlier on Tuesday that they are interested in signing Crystal Palace full-back Pape Souare as a potential alternative to Kenedy - their first choice target currently with Chelsea."
