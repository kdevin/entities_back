  "description": "Carlos Carvalhal believes Swansea showed further signs of progress under his management in their FA Cup draw with Wolves.",
  "content": "Swansea, bottom of the Premier League, were unable to beat the team at the top of the Championship and face a replay after Saturday's goalless stalemate at Molineux which saw both sides reduced to 10 men.But Carvalhal was pleased given the limited amount of time he has had to work with his players since taking over as manager on December 28.\"I am very pleased with my players because the commitment and attitude was good and we played with good quality against a very strong team,\" said Carvalhal.\"Two days after I arrived we played against Watford and we won. Three days after we played against Tottenham and in normal circumstances we never lose that game.\"Now after four days we prepare a team to play against the strongest team in the Championship and we achieve a clean sheet and take the game to a replay.\"I am very happy as I feel we progressed to another step today. Playing after two days and three days and four days it is hard to recover and introduce a new dynamic, new information and new ideas in such a short space of time but I amvery pleased.\"I am confident we will progress again now because we have one full week to prepare for the next game at Newcastle. I don't wish to play more games because we need training.\"Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo was happy with his side's performance having been the first to go down to 10 men when Ruben Vinagre saw red on 40 minutes for a tackle on Nathan Dyer. Swansea themselves went a man down on 67 with Leroy Fer's red card for a trip on Helder Costa.\"I think the team played really well. When you go down to 10 men you have to find solutions and even with 10 I think we controlled the game really well.\"Swansea did not create enough and even with 10 players we were better than them. I am sorry for the result but not the performance.\"Sometimes you have to adapt but some things never change - the desire to win. And we showed that today, the whole squad with a lot of players coming in and this is what we want.\"",
