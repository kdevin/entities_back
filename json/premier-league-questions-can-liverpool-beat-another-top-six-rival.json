  "content": "This week wasn't just about transfers as all 20 Premier League clubs were in league action with another round of fixtures to come this weekend.Burnley and Manchester City kick things off live on Sky Sports Premier League at 12.30pm on Saturday while Super Sunday sees Crystal Palace host Newcastle before Spurs take on Liverpool at Anfield.Watford and Chelsea round it all off on Monday Night Football at Vicarage Road with kick-off at 8pm.Can Sergio Aguero maintain his hot streak against Burnley? (Burnley v Manchester City, Saturday from 11.30am, live on Sky Sports Premier League)Manchester City have most certainly recovered from their first Premier League defeat of the season to Liverpool last month and will be in confident mood ahead of their trip to Turf Moor, live on Sky Sports Premier League on Saturday.Burnley have endured a difficult run of late, failing to win in any of their last eight league fixtures and they have already lost to Arsenal, Spurs, Liverpool and Manchester United at home this season.Ben Mee and the rest of Burnley's defenders will be particularly wary of the threat posed by Sergio Aguero. The Argentine has scored seven goals in his last seven league games and has found the net in all four of his matches against Burnley, netting six in total.Will Christian Benteke finally end his Selhurst Park goal drought? (Crystal Palace v Newcastle United, Super Sunday from 1.30pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League)Crystal Palace (13th) and Newcastle (14th) may appear to be in decent positions in the Premier League table but they will both be looking nervously over their shoulder towards the relegation zone.The home side will be hoping that Christian Benteke can finally break his goalscoring drought at Selhurst Park after the Belgian scored just his second league goal of the season against West Ham in midweek.Benteke has failed to score in all 10 of his Premier League appearances at Selhurst Park this season, despite playing 780 minutes, having 22 shots and an xG total of 3.64 in games there.Will Liverpool continue their good home record against teams in the top six? (Liverpool v Tottenham, Super Sunday from 4.15pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League)Under Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool have had an infuriating tendency to drop points against teams in the bottom half while performing well against their direct rivals in the top six.Klopp is unbeaten in his last 12 home Premier League meetings against the other top six sides (W6 D6) since a 1-0 defeat to Man Utd in January 2016 while Liverpool have gone 14 league games without defeat at Anfield.They face a Spurs team that should be high on confidence following their comprehensive 2-0 win over Manchester United but Mauricio Pochettino has struggled to find a way to beat their top six rivals away from home, winning just once in 18 games.Can Javier Gracia halt Watford's slide? (Watford v Chelsea, Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports Premier League from 7pm)It seems a long time ago since Watford were tipped to challenge for a Europa League place following a strong start to the campaign as they have been sinking fast for a number of weeks.Watford have collected just six points from their last 11 games (W1 D3 L7) - which unsurprisingly, is the worst record of any side in the division in that period.Javier Gracia oversaw a 0-0 draw against Stoke in his first Premier League game in charge and will be looking for more of the same against a Chelsea team that suffered a shock 3-0 home defeat to Bournemouth on Wednesday.Can Bournemouth stretch their unbeaten run in the Premier League? (Bournemouth v Stoke, Saturday 3pm)Bournemouth's spectacular 3-0 win over Chelsea stretched their unbeaten run in the Premier League to six games (W3 D3) only Spurs, unbeaten in seven, have a better record.That run has lifted Eddie Howe's side up into 10th and Callum Wilson's form has been a major factor behind their rise as the striker has been directly involved in six goals in his last six league games (four goals, two assists).However, Stoke have shown signs of progress under Paul Lambert, claiming four points from his two games in charge as well as keeping clean sheets in both.Will West Ham's poor form against the promoted sides continue? (Brighton v West Ham, Saturday 3pm)West Ham have been on a good run under David Moyes, losing just once in their last 10 Premier League outings (W4 D5 L1) but they have struggled for points against last season's promoted sides so far.A third of Newcastle's six league wins this season came against West Ham while Saturday's opponents Brighton came away from the London Stadium with an emphatic 3-0 win back in October.Should Brighton complete a league double over West Ham, it will be the first time that West Ham have been beaten four times by promoted clubs in a season since 2006/07.Can Swansea continue their resurgence under Carlos Carvalhal? (Leicester v Swansea, Saturday 3pm)Swansea looked down and out a month or so ago but the arrival of Carlos Carvalhal seems to have reinvigorated the squad as they have been on an excellent run.They taken 10 points from a possible 15 since the Portuguese took charge and have won back-to-back games for the first time this season, beating Liverpool and Arsenal at the Liberty.Swansea do have a poor record against Leicester, though, with the Foxes unbeaten in their last 13 home games against Swansea (W10 D3) - a run which stretches back to October 1950!Will Manchester United bounce back from their Wembley defeat to Spurs? (Manchester United v Huddersfield, Saturday 3pm)Manchester United were disappointing in defeat against Spurs in midweek and Jose Mourinho will be expecting a much-improved display from his team for the visit of Huddersfield.Huddersfield head to Old Trafford in poor form having failed to win any of their last seven league games (D3 L4) while their opponents have been beaten just twice (by Manchester City) at home in their previous 39 league matches.United haven't lost consecutive Premier League games since May 2017, which featured a loss away to Tottenham, but were defeated by Huddersfield in October. Lightning couldn't strike twice, could it?Could Daniel Sturridge score on his first Premier League start for a fourth Premier League club? (West Brom v Southampton, Saturday 3pm)Alan Pardew hailed West Brom's loan signing of Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool as a 'coup' for the club and the striker made his debut as a late substitute in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City.Despite Jay Rodriguez's good form, Sturridge will be pushing for a start against Southampton this weekend and if he does so he'll be looking to continue his fine full debut record in the Premier League.Sturridge has scored on his full Premier League debut for Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers and Liverpool, only failing to do so for Chelsea. Southampton defenders beware...Could Theo Walcott come back to haunt his former club? (Arsenal v Everton, Saturday 5.30pm)All eyes will be on Arsenal's attacking line-up against Everton with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in line for his debut and Henrikh Mkhitaryan pushing for his first start.Aubameyang developed into a world-class goalscorer with previous club Borussia Dortmund and while Arsenal could carry a huge attacking threat going forwards, defensively they must improve after a 3-1 defeat to Swansea.One man in particular they will be wary of facing is the returning Theo Walcott who after half a season of inactivity at the Emirates has exploded into life since joining Everton, scoring twice and providing an assist in two games."
