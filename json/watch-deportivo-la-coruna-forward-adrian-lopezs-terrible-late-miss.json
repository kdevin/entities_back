  "description": "Adrian Lopez could have snatched a point for La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, but fluffed his lines late on.",
  "content": "In the 92nd minute of three added on at the end of the game, Deportivo were 2-1 down to Valencia but camped inside the opposition half searching for an equaliser.It nearly came too as Arsenal loanee Lucas Perez chipped a delightful ball over the top of the Valencia defence and it landed at the feet of Lopez, who only had goalkeeper Neto to beat.However, with the pressure and angle of the shot, he could only sky his effort across the face of goal and over the crossbar much to the dismay of his team-mates and staff on the bench.The game ended in a 2-1 win for Valencia, which saw them go eight points clear of Real Madrid, while Deportivo remain in 17th place with 16th points.Hit play on the video above to see the terrible miss from Lopez."
