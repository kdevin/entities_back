Quique Sanchez Flores has not said yes yet but will answer tomorrow. He will either give them an immediate yes or he will stay at Espanyol.\"My instinct is that the proposal is so interesting plus the fact that Espanyol have not kept their promises from when Quique first arrived suggests to me that he will announce his departure from Espanyol.\"The 52-year-old proved a success during his previous spell in England. He reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 2016 and also guided Watford to 13th place in the Premier League.Despite his success, he was replaced by Walter Mazzarri at the end of his solitary season in England.Weeks later, he signed a three-year contract as Espanyol head coach, he has 18 months left on the deal.",
