  "description": "Former Chelsea winger Florent Malouda is to appeal a two-match suspension from international football at the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Wednesday.",
  "content": "Malouda made 80 international appearances for France between 2004 and 2012, but became eligible to play for the country of his birth, French Guiana, as it is a non-FIFA association.He played for French Guiana in last year's Caribbean Cup but was ruled ineligible to represent the nation at the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup because the North and Central American tournament uses FIFA rules.The 37-year-old played French Guiana's second match in the United States last July anyway, meaning that the game was forfeited to Honduras after originally finishing as a 0-0 draw.He was suspended for two games by CONCACAF, given a stadium ban and fined, while the Guiana Football League was also fined.Malouda, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012, last played club football for Indian Super League side Delhi Dynamos just over a year ago.",
