  "content": "Ciftci was on loan at Plymouth Argyle for the first half of the campaign, but that agreement was cancelled, allowing him to head to Fir Park.Sky sources reported earlier on Tuesday the 25-year-old Turkish player was closing on the move and that he had flown to Tenerife ahead of the Motherwell squad, who later headed there for their winter break training camp.On arriving at the club, Ciftci said: \"My first impressions have been really good. It feels like home already. It gives me a good feeling already.\"I obviously know the league and the teams. I've played a lot of times against Motherwell as well so it will be a good place to kick on.\"The signing of Ciftci, who will wear shirt No 23, is third time lucky for the Steelmen, having came close to securing his signature on two previous occasions.\"Last January it was in the last minutes of the transfer window and it just didn't go through because of paperwork. Then in the summer, it was a bit different as well,\" he added.\"Now it is the third time and when the chance came, I just grabbed it and now I am here thankfully.\"Ciftci, who began his senior career with Portsmouth, could make his Motherwell debut against Hamilton at Fir Park in the Scottish Cup fourth-round tie on January 20.Motherwell, ninth in the Scottish Premiership under Stephen Robinson, have been searching for forward replacements for Louis Moult, who recently joined Preston, and signed former Portsmouth striker Curtis Main.Ciftci, who has played just four games for Celtic since Brendan Rodgers took over as manager in 2016, signed for Celtic from Dundee United in the summer of 2015.He has since spent time on loan at three clubs, including Eskisehirspor in Turkey and Pogon Szczecin in Poland."
