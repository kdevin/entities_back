  "description": "Swansea manager Carlos Carvalhal has made it clear he is putting Premier League survival before the FA Cup.",
  "content": "The Swans host the Sky Bet Championship leaders in their third-round replay on Wednesday following a 0-0 draw at Molineux earlier in the month.Swansea are bottom of the Premier League, four points from safety, and Carvalhal will rest some of his players ahead of Monday's game against Liverpool, live on Sky Sports.\"Yes, I will do that, for sure, I will make changes. Our main competition is the Premier League,\" he said.\"We respect the cup, we respect Wolves, but we need to play players who are coming back from injuries, we must see the players and give them a chance also to play, so it's natural that we will make changes on Wednesday.\"We are looking at the players every day and we have a clear idea what we need from the team. This is very clear.\"We know our players, but if you have one game to see one player, it's one thing and working with them for two weeks, you can check better and better.\"If you have two games in 20 days and see the players in the games, you will be more clear about the situation, of course.\"This is normal. We will try to see all the players and try to give all the players a chance to play and also to progress them.\""
