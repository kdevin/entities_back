  "content": "The Sky Bet Championship side have refused to allow the Scotsman to leave Villa Park and return to his parent club midway through the season.\nIt is understood the original deal did not contain a recall option.\nScotland international Snodgrass joined Villa in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements under then-manager Slaven Bilic.\nBut Bilic was sacked in November following the Hammers' poor start to the season, and new manager David Moyes was keen to have Snodgrass at his disposal for the remainder of the campaign.\nWith Villa keen to hold on to their loan signing, Snodgrass is expected to remain in the Midlands until the summer.\nWest Ham signed Snodgrass from Hull for £10m last January and the club's hierarchy are not keen to spend additional money on releasing the 30-year-old from his loan agreement.\n",
