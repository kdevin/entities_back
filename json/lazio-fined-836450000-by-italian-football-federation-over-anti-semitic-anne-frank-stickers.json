  "description": "Lazio have been fined €50,000 by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) over an anti-Semitic display by a small section their team's supporters.",
  "content": "The sanction relates to an incident at the end of their win over Cagliari on October 22 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.Lazio supporters littered the pitch with stickers of Anne Frank, the young diarist who died in the Holocaust, wearing a jersey of their city rival Roma and bearing anti-Semitic slogans.The FIGC's prosecutor had requested the club was fined and that they were also forced to play two matches behind closed doors.Lazio argued it had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the incident and that it was only a small number of fans who carried it out and the FIGC agreed it would be unfair to punish all of the club's fans for the actions of only 20 people.There was worldwide outrage after the incident and a criminal investigation was opened.A passage from Frank's diary was read out at all soccer matches in Italy the following week, while there was also a minute's silence before they kicked off to promote Holocaust remembrance.Lazio players warmed up for their subsequent 2-1 win at Bologna in jerseys bearing an image of Frank and the words \"No to anti-Semitism\".",
