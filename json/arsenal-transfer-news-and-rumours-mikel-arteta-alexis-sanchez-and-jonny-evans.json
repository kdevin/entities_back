  "content": "Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger could cut short his latest contract and move into the boardroom in the summer and is eyeing Mikel Arteta as his hand-picked successor, the Sunday Mirror reports.His current deal reportedly contains a clause which allows both parties to review the situation at the end of the season and Wenger harbours doubts about continuing beyond the summer, with Arteta impressing as a coach under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.The same newspaper also claims that Wenger will let Alexis Sanchez move to Man City for £35m this month - providing he can sign Riyad Mahrez to replace him.The Frenchman wants a proven high-profile signing in place before he will sanction Sanchez's move, with Mahrez having handed in a transfer request at Leicester in the summer.Arsenal have made a fresh enquiry for West Brom captain Jonny Evans, according to Sky sources.The Gunners expressed an interest in Evans last summer, along with a number of Premier League clubs, with the 30-year-old having 18 months left on his current deal at The Hawthorns.Manchester United and Arsenal have joined the £30m battle for Shakhtar Donetsk's Brazil star Fred, the Daily Star on Sunday reports.The attacking midfielder is attracting interest from a number of European clubs - including big spenders Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain - but the duo are thought to be the frontrunners.Arsenal are also monitoring Barcelona forward Jose Arnaiz, reports Spanish outlet AS.The forward, 22, joined Barcelona from Real Valladolid in a €3.4m (£3m) deal last summer and has predominantly featured for their reserve side Barca B.However, he has netted three goals in three appearances for Ernesto Valverde's first team and has a €20m (£17.7m) buyout clause until 2020 and a €40m (£35.5m) buyout clause for the remainder of his contract until 2022.",
