  "content": "Sky Sports News understands Ejaria will be a replacement for Didier Ndong, who completed a loan move to Watford with an obligation to buy in the summer should certain criteria be met.Ejaria told Sunderland's official website: \"I'm really happy because I've wanted to go out on loan for a while to get regular first-team football under my belt.\"I'd say that I'm a player that likes to get on the ball quite a lot and make things happen, I'll try to create chances and hopefully score some goals as well.\"I'll always give one hundred percent and work hard for the team.\"The club has also signed teenage striker Connor Shields on an 18-month deal from Scottish side Albion Rovers.Sunderland have also contacted Bournemouth over the availability of midfielder Emerson Hyndman, according to Sky sources, but it's unclear whether he is an alternative transfer target or wanted in addition to Ejaria.Ejaria, an unused substitute in England's U20 World Cup-winning squad last year, made his league debut for Liverpool at Anfield in a resounding 6-1 victory over Watford in November 2016 but is yet to break into Jurgen Klopp's first team.He started out at Arsenal and spent nine years in north London before moving to Merseyside in 2014.Sunderland manager Chris Coleman's also added former Brighton player Kazenga LuaLua to his ranks last week on a short-term deal until the end of his season."
