  "description": "Jose Mourinho has warned making history at Manchester United will be more difficult than at Chelsea.",
  "content": "Mourinho pledged his \"total\" commitment to United earlier on Thursday following reports he could leave the club this summer, two years into his three-year deal, and Sky sources understand talks over a new contract are under way.The Portuguese has won a league title before the end of his second season at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, but United are 15 points behind current leaders and rivals Manchester City.Mourinho last week bemoaned United's inability to compete with the transfer spend of City and Paris Saint-Germain, and admits the club records he achieved during his time at Chelsea will be tough to replicate at Old Trafford.\"Everybody knows that in Italy - I am Inter, Inter, Inter. In Spain - I am Real Madrid, Real Madrid, Real Madrid,\" said Mourinho. \"Everybody knows this kind of emotional connection that I keep with the clubs and that's the way I'm doing.\"The difference between Chelsea and United is that I really belong to Chelsea's history because I won three Premier Leagues, I won cups, lots of things there, the club won their first Premier League in 2004.\"So I have a history there and here my history is the history of somebody who works hard every day.\"[United] won the only competition the club never won, but everybody knows the Europa League is not the 'El Dorado' of football, and I come in a moment where it is more difficult to make history.\"Mourinho denied there have been any surprises in the help and commitment he has received after taking on the job at Manchester United, but said the \"conditions\" at a club are a different matter, saying it is part of his job to create them.United have so far failed to win a title under three different permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, and Mourinho indicated he is laying the foundations for a future successor.\"If a manager leaves a club one day even without big success, but creates conditions for the next one to come in and have success, that's also a very important part of this job,\" said Mourinho, whose side hosts Sky Bet Championship high-flyers Derby in the FA Cup third round on Friday.\"So when I work in this club I'm not just working to myself, I try to work also for the future of the club.\"Manchester United return to Premier League action against Stoke on January 15, live on Sky Sports Premier League."
