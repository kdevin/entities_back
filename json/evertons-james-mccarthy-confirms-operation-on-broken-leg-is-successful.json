He is someone I really admire and it wasn't nice to see.\"James will be back from it.\"I want to go out there every week and do as well as I possibly can to show James that he will be back and he will be fine.\"Rondon, who was visibly upset after the incident at the weekend, posted a message of support for McCarthy after the game.Former Everton player Ross Barkley also took to Twitter on Saturday to wish his old team-mate a speedy recovery."
