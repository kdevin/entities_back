  "description": "Roy Hodgson believes Crystal Palace's modern-day rivalry with Brighton is a positive for both clubs.",
  "content": "Palace visit their rivals in the third round of the FA Cup on Monday, less than two months after the Premier League fixture - also at the Amex Stadium - in which the hosts accused a minority of the visiting fans of \"disorder\".Their Championship play-off semi-finals of 2013 were also heated affairs and intensified that rivalry over 50 years after Hodgson visited Selhurst Park as a supporter when no such enmity existed.\"It's quite good to have a match hyped up as being a particular derby, of particular importance to the fans,\" said Hodgson.\"That's good for football and good for the club, as long as you don't get incidents, or hooliganism, and all the things that can happen around a football match that we all deplore.\"It focuses people's attention. We have a lot of derbies in a way, but they don't get hyped up as derbies in the same way as Tottenham and West Ham did, or between Arsenal and Tottenham, for example.\"When we play Chelsea, for example, it's a derby, but people don't hype it up in the same way.\"I don't remember it (from when I was a Palace supporter). I'm going back to the 1960s. I left England in the early 1970s, so I'm thinking more through the 50s and 60s when I was a true supporter, coming and standing on the terraces.\"Someone might prove me wrong here, say 'blimey, in 1959 Palace-Brighton was a massive game' - well I don't remember it.\""
