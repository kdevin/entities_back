I think the decision - to be [made] at the end of the season and not last week - is a good decision for the team and a good decision for him to finish playing football and not injured or with some problem.\"So we are all happy and in the end of the season I expect him to join, unless he changes his mind, but the club would be very happy for him to do that. I would be very happy also for him to do that.\""
