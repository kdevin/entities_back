We didn't create too much but we would have liked to have thought we could have got something out of it.\n\"We are not far away. We know that. We will look to work hard this week and look to put it right.\"\nGeorges-Kevin Nkoudou came off the substitutes' bench at Selhurst Park to make his debut having arrived on loan from Tottenham on Tuesday.\nMee added: \"He looks lively with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of energy. He's going to show us what quality he's got.\"\nThe 22-year-old former Nantes and Marseille player joined Spurs for £9.4m in August 2016 and has made six appearances for them this season, the latest as a substitute in the FA Cup win over AFC Wimbledon.\nBurnley now turn their attention to Jose Mourinho's Manchester United who they host on Saturday.\n",
