Sky Sports News understands Manchester United, on the other hand, are prepared to pay Sanchez more than £350,000 per week.\nDespite United's interest, City are understood to believe the Arsenal forward would prefer a move to the Etihad.\nHowever, their need to add to their strikeforce has been reduced by the news that Gabriel Jesus is likely to be fit again in a fortnight.\nHe was initially expected to be out for up to two months after suffering a knee injury at Crystal Palace at the end of December.\nCity also feel that adding another forward could upset the equilibrium in a squad that has won 20 out of 23 Premier League matches this season.\nWhile it appears City have admitted defeat in their pursuit of Sanchez, Guardiola still wants to add a centre-back during the January transfer window.\nCity have enquired about Jonny Evans, and he is still one of the defenders that is interesting Guardiola.\n",
