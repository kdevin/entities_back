  "content": "United play Burnley on Saturday in the return fixture of December's 2-2 draw at Old Trafford, which saw Jose Mourinho's side rescue a point after a stoppage-time equaliser.\nMourinho's side could yet be boosted by the addition of Sanchez, though, after Arsene Wenger admitted a transfer could still happen before this weekend's fixtures.\nDyche insists Burnley's game plan will not change for one player, but believes Sanchez's potential arrival at Manchester United will have a long-term impact on his side's future transfer activity.\n\"It creates a tougher challenge because every time one of the super powers spends enormous money on a player that drip-feeds down the market,\" he said.\n\"So every player you then phone about has miraculously gone considerably up in value because they'll say 'well if he's worth that our players must be somewhere near as good as that'.\n\"So where does the next move from us come from? Where's the next valuation on one of our players or one of our targets?\"\nSky Sports News understands Manchester United are prepared to pay Sanchez more than £350,000 per week, but Dyche admitted Burnley are still some way off being able to offer six-figure weekly wages.\n\"It will be a while I think,\" he said. \"Our chairman certainly backs our team the best the board feel we can. We're quite a long way off that but the numbers have jumped the last couple of years, so who knows?\"\nBurnley will be without Jon Walters for the United game and the next six to eight weeks after he had minor knee surgery to trim a cartilage.\nStephen Ward and Chris Wood will also not be fit in time for Saturday's match, but Scott Arfield and Charlie Taylor will be in contention, Dyche confirmed.\n",
