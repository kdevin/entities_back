  "description": "Virgil van Dijk was absent from the Liverpool team to face Premier League leaders Manchester City on Sunday.",
  "content": "The Dutch defender, who scored on his Reds debut against Everton in the FA Cup, is struggling with a tight hamstring and was not risked by manager Jurgen Klopp.\"He is a little bit injured - not really serious but too much,\" said Klopp. \"It was immediately after the game [against Everton] he felt a little bit. We made an assessment.\"If it's the last game of the season maybe you take the risk but it's not the last game of the season obviously. That's why we can't take the risk.\"Van Dijk joined Liverpool from Southampton this month for a club-record Â£75m - and was also a target for Manchester City.Klopp named Dejan Lovren in place of Van Dijk in the centre of defence with Loris Karius preferred to Simon Mignolet in goal.Liverpool sit fourth in the Premier League table, 18 points behind City."
