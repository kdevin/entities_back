I think the player wants to come, to be part of our squad but the most important part of the negotiations are still there so we have to continue to work.\n\"We are looking for someone who can replace Charlie or the quality of Charlie.\n\"Obviously it is not the same player, but this is our target now.\n\"I don't know if he will be ready [for Brighton] because we have to test the player.\"\nThe Saints have been in pursuit of Carrillo for the past week and saw an initial £17.6m offer for the 26-year-old rejected, Sky Sports News understands.\nCarrillo has made 22 appearances this season, but has started only twice in Ligue1. He has scored 20 goals in over 50 games for Monaco since signing from Estudiantes in 2015.\n",
