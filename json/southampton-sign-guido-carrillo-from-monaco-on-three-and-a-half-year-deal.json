It's a great feeling to be a part of this club.\"Lots of things attracted me. I know Southampton from watching the Premier League from when I was small, I've always regarded it as the most important league in the world.\"I obviously know the coaching staff, I've worked with them in Argentina and I also spoke with some players who were former teammates in Argentina, who are now playing in the Premier League and they told me all about the club and gave it a shining reference. Therefore, I had no doubts when I took the decision.\"Vice chairman Les Reed said: \"A huge amount of work has gone into completing this transfer, and we are thrilled that we have now been able to push it through to completion.\"Guido represents a very exciting addition to our attacking options ahead of the final months of the season, possessing plenty of experience at the highest level, while also having the potential and the desire to improve even further.\"We are confident he will benefit us not only in the remainder of this campaign, but in the years to come.\"The Saints had been in pursuit of Carrillo for the past week and saw an initial £17.6m offer for the 26-year-old rejected, Sky Sports News understands.Carrillo has made 22 appearances this season, but has started only twice in Ligue 1. He has scored 20 goals in over 50 games for Monaco since signing from Estudiantes in 2015."
