  "content": "Toffees striker Oumar Niasse cancelled out Jay Rodriguez's opener to rescue a point with his first touch, 57 seconds after coming off the bench.But Allardyce was left disappointed following his 1,000th game as a manager, as Everton's wait for a first Premier League victory since December 18 continued.\"The fans want to see us win and they want to see footballers that are paid to pass the ball pass the ball to each other,\" he told Sky Sports. \"They saw very little of that today.\"I've got no problem with the fans booing us because we deserved booing, that's what happens. We didn't play very well and the fans show their disapproval, and rightly so, because they pay money to come and watch us.\"Players should listen to that like I do and say, 'We've got to get these fans singing for us like they were doing a few weeks ago'.\"It was difficult to watch today. There were a lot of nerves out there today and that resulted in a lot of misplaced passes and their goal, which came from our goal-kick.\"I'm pleased that in the end we got a point through our substitute making an impact and popping in an equaliser. At least this is a positive result because we didn't deserve any more than a point, that's for sure.\"Everton's comeback was marred by a horrific injury to midfielder James McCarthy, who Allardyce confirmed has sustained a double leg fracture, following a collision with Baggies striker Salomon Rondon.And the Toffees boss was furious with the error-strewn performance which led to the Republic of Ireland international's injury.\"It's all through our own fault and our own stupid play in that particular area,\" Allardyce added. \"You don't play the ball to people who are marked and are facing our own goal, that's something you learn in the early stages of your career.\"We've gave the ball away but James recovered brilliantly to stop what might have been a goal, and suffered a very bad injury because of it.\"Frustration is an understatement, I'm holding it in. The players didn't perform today, they are well aware of their lack of performance in an Everton shirt at Goodison.\"We have to pick ourselves up and make sure we are more determined mentally. The players are suffering with a mental problem at the moment and we have to overcome that and bring the ability out of them that we saw when I first arrived.\"We, in the background, are the only ones who can make that change and we must work very hard to do that.\"",
