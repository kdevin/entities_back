  "description": "The January transfer window usually sees less business than its summer counterpart. This year, though, major clubs across Europe are plotting big-money deals which could see a new record set for total spend in the mid-season market.",
  "content": "Our friends at Football Whispers have scoured the continental press to bring you the latest transfer rumours.Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has identified Harry Kane and Mauricio Pochettino as replacements for Cristiano Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane next season. (La Porteria)James Rodriguez has not ruled out a return to Real Madrid. The Colombian is on loan at Bayern Munich until the summer of 2019. The Bundesliga club have an option to buy him, but it isn't compulsory. If Zidane leaves, he could be tempted by a return to Spain, but knows if the Frenchman stays, there is no place for him in Madrid. (Marca)Levante are interested in Loic Remy. The Frenchman only joined Las Palmas from Chelsea this summer, but could make the move to a La Liga rival. (Superdeporte)Lassana Diarra has turned down Manchester United and will sign a contract with PSG. The midfielder was set to join the Ligue 1 club before Jose Mourinho got involved, having worked with the midfielder at Chelsea and Real Madrid. The 33-year-old free agent, who last played for Al Jazira, was tempted by a return to England, but has opted to move to Paris. (Le Parisien)Lucas Moura has emerged as a target for Tottenham. Pochettino wants to strengthen his attacking options and sees the Brazilian, who's out of favour at Paris Saint-Germain, as a perfect fit. The two clubs are far away from an agreement though, with Spurs preferring a loan. PSG want to get Lucas off their books permanently due to Financial Fair Play restrictions. (L'Equipe)Borussia Dortmund have set an asking price of €70m (£61.7m) for Arsenal target Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Should the Gabon international leave, the German side have identified Gunners forward Olivier Giroud as a possible replacement. (Kicker)After playing for West Ham in their FA Cup tie against Shrewsbury, West Ham youngster Reece Oxford cannot be sold to anyone other than Borussia Monchengladbach, where he spent the first part of the season on loan. That's due to FIFA regulations which forbid a player from featuring for more than two clubs in a single campaign. Gladbach director of sport Max Eberl, who wants the defender back in Germany, said: \"Reece cannot play for three clubs in one season, we're just waiting.\" (Bild)Juventus have set their sights on a summer move for Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin. The Serie A champions have been watching the 22-year-old since 2014. (Tuttosport)Torino striker Andrea Belotti is AC Milan's dream forward. With Andre Silva failing to live up to expectations, the Rossoneri will make a move for Belotti in the summer. (Corriere dello Sport)Daniel Sturridge is edging closer to a move to Italy. Liverpool have offered Inter Milan the striker on loan until the end of the season. (Gazzetta dello Sport)Inter expect to hear from Barcelona about their offer for Rafinha by Friday. The Italian side want to bring the Brazilian to the San Siro, but can't afford him permanently at the moment due to Financial Fair Play constraints. Talks initially broke down because Barca wanted an obligation to buy if Inter qualify for the Champions League. The Italian side don't want to make that commitment so are proposing a free loan with an option of making it permanent for €35m (£30.9m). (Corriere della Sera)"
