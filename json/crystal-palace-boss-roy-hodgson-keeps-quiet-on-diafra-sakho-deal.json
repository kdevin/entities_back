  "content": "According to Sky sources, Palace have agreed a fee with West Ham for Sakho understood to be between £10m and £12m.\nThe Senegal international is yet to start a Premier League game for the Hammers this season, scoring four goals in the 17 games he has featured in this term.\nThe Palace boss is keen to sign another striker in January, with first-choice forward Christian Benteke having scored just once so far in this campaign.\nAsked about the club's pursuit of Sakho, Hodgson said: \"I'm not prepared to talk about any players. There is bound to be conflicting reports.\n\"It would be very foolish of me to start commenting on anybody at the moment.\n\"We are doing it as best we can and as professionally as we can.\n\"It is better to keep quiet on the subject.\"\nHodgson has previously revealed that Palace need to sign up to seven players in the January window and the former England boss says everyone at Selhurst Park is working hard to bring players in.\n\"Our plans have never changed,\" Hodgson said. \"We have known almost from the moment I came to the club that we were light in certain areas.\n\"We didn't have enough of a certain type of player in areas of the field.\n\"We have always been thinking that when the January transfer window comes around that we will try and resolve some of these problems.\n\"We have been thinking about that since I came in September and the people who are working on this, our scouting department, Doug Freedman, Steve Parish and our owners are working overtime to try and identify people.\"\n",
