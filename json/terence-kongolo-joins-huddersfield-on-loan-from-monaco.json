  "description": "Monaco defender Terence Kongolo has joined Huddersfield on loan until the end of the season.",
  "content": "Sky Sports News had reported the clubs were in advanced talks over a deal, with Kongolo becoming Huddersfield's first signing of the January transfer window.Kongolo, 23, established himself at Dutch side Feyenoord, earning a call-up to the Netherlands national team.But he signed for French champions Monaco last summer on a five-year deal.Huddersfield head coach David Wagner said: \"Terence is a top player who we've followed from his time at Feyenoord. His big summer move to Monaco put him out of our reach at the time, but we're delighted we can bring him in on loan now.\"He is a high-quality young centre-back and will provide us with a great option for the rest of the Premier League season. With Michael Hefele and Jon Gorenc StankoviÄ‡ returning from long-term injuries, it was important to have this.\"Terence has qualities that will really suit our style of play. He's athletic and mobile and he plays on the front foot in the way he defends and uses the ball. I'm excited to work with him during the course of the season.\"Wagner had bemoaned his side's sloppy defending in their 3-0 defeat to Leicester on New Year's Day.The defeat left Huddersfield winless in their last four Premier League outings, although they remain in 11th place in the Premier League on 24 points - six above the drop zone.Kongolo arrives at the John Smith's Stadium with Champions League experience, having represented Monaco in the group stage of this year's competition."
