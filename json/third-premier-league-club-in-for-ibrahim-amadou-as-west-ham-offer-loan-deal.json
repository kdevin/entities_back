  "description": "A third Premier League club has joined West Ham and Crystal Palace in trying to sign  Lille's midfielder Ibrahim Amadou, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "Sky Sports News understands the new club which has entered the race to sign the in-demand Lille captain is 'bigger' than either of the two London clubs.West Ham have offered £2m to take the 24-year-old on loan and want to include an option to buy him for £14m in the summer.Crystal Palace had an offer for him rejected on Sunday.The offer from Roy Hodgson's side was similar to West Ham's, except the option to buy was reduced to £10m.Lille want £18m if they are to sell Amadou, although they are willing to sanction a loan deal if it includes an obligation for the new club to buy him.With the transfer window closing on Wednesday night, all parties have only a few hours to conclude any deal for the holding midfielder, who can also play centre-half."
