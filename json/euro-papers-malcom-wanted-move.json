  "description": "Despite the January transfer window being closed, that hasn't stopped the speculation surrounding players' futures.",
  "content": "Our friends at Football Whispers have scoured the continental press to bring you the latest transfer rumours.\nBordeaux attacker Malcom, who was subject of Arsenal and Tottenham transfer talk in January, has admitted he wanted to leave the club during the transfer window. \"It's my dream to progress in my career,\" he said. \"I spoke to the president, he told me that he knew it was my dream, but that he needed me. I told him he could count on me until the end of the season, I will do everything to help Bordeaux finish in the top six in Ligue 1.\" (Telefoot)\nOlivier Giroud says it was an easy choice to leave Arsenal for Chelsea once he knew of the Blues' interest in him. The Frenchman says he wanted to stay at the Emirates in the summer to try and get into the team despite the signing of Alexandre Lacazette, but knew after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's arrival that he had to move on.\n\"The coach wanted to recruit a new forward with Aubameyang. That made it three strikers at Arsenal, including me. That's why I decided to leave,\" he said. \"The choice was pretty clear and obvious once I knew that [Antonio Conte] wanted to work with me. I know that he likes me, that he appreciates how I play. I hope we will work well together.\" (Telefoot)\nChelsea were willing to put an option in Michy Batshuayi's loan deal to Borussia Dortmund that could see him join the German club permanently for an agreed price. But they also wanted a buyback clause in any such deal, something the Bundesliga side were unwilling to agree on, meaning both parties decided there would be no purchase option in the loan for the striker. (Bild)\nBorussia Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin says the club feels like home. The 29-year-old came through the youth system there, before leaving in 2011 to play for Real Madrid and Liverpool, before returning in 2013. He says he'd like to coach them in the future. When asked where he saw himself in ten years time, he said: \"On the sideline in our stadium, as coach of this club.\" (DW)\nRoma sporting director Monchi would have sold Chelsea transfer target Edin Dzeko should the striker have wanted to leave. He said: \"I am convinced that if Edin Dzeko had wanted to go to Chelsea, he would've done, and if Roma had wanted him to go, he would've gone. We were all 100 per cent convinced we wanted to continue working together.\" (Premium Sport)\nAtletico Madrid winger Yannick Carrasco will be a Juventus transfer target this summer. The Serie A side will not be willing to pay anywhere near his €100m (£88.2m) release clause though. (Tuttosport)\nDespite Gianluigi Buffon's contract at Juventus running out in the summer, former Italy teammate Antonio Cassano has backed the 40-year-old goalkeeper to carry on playing until he's 45. \"Did you see his saves in Bergamo? He's got everything, how can someone like that not play anymore?\" the forward said. \"A goalkeeper can continue playing until the age of 45.\" (Corriere della Sera)\nReal Madrid will not be able to bring back James Rodriguez from Bayern Munich this summer, even if they want to. The Colombian is on a two-year loan deal at the Allianz Arena and the German giants are the only club who can decide to cut that short. (Marca)\nThe executive commission of La Liga will meet in the coming week and could offer a new contract to league president Javier Tebas. They want to increase the 55-year-old's salary and may even include a release clause in his contract to make sure he is not prized away by another organisation. Tebas has been linked with a move to Serie A. (Marca)\n",
