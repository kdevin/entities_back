  "description": "Goalkeeper Ross Fitzsimons cost Notts County a point after a moment of madness against Crawley on Tuesday night.",
  "content": "With the game tied at 1-1 deep into second-half stoppage time, the County stopper inexplicably kicked out at Jimmy Smith after he had gathered a corner and before he was about to launch the ball downfield.Fitzsimons was then dismissed and Crawley were awarded a penalty, which Josh Payne slotted home past substitute goalkeeper Branislav Pindroch to seal a 2-1 win for the away side at Meadow Lane.Notts County boss Kevin Nolan admitted that Fitzsimons was in the wrong, but felt it should have been a goal kick rather than a corner in the build-up.\"It's a goal kick and not a corner,\" said Nolan. \"But listen I am not going to try to look after Ross Fitzsimons in this because we all take accountability for our own actions.\"It has cost us a point, but if it's a goal kick then it doesn't happen.\"Hit play on the video at the top of the page to see the goalkeeper's moment of madness"
