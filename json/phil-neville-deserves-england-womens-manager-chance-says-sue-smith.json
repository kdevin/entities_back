  "description": "Phil Neville deserves the chance to become the England Women's manager, but would need someone with experience in the women's game alongside him, according to former international Sue Smith.",
  "content": "The former Manchester United and Everton defender has been set for talks over the vacant role according to Sky sources, but any deal to succeed Mark Sampson has yet to be completed.Smith, who was capped 93 times by England, believes that Neville would be a suitable candidate for the role but needs backroom staff that have been involved in women's football.\"Phil Neville's probably got to be given a chance,\" Smith told Sportswomen. \"I think the fact that he's played at the highest level, he's coached at the highest level and I think he can maybe bring all of these experiences to take England to the next level.\"I think he needs people around him that have been involved in the women's game, that know the women's game.\"Smith has tipped former England captain Casey Stoney to be the ideal person to come in and assist Neville within the England set-up.Smith said: \"I look at Casey Stoney who's maybe coming towards the end of her career, so could she be an assistant manager underneath Phil Neville, could she learn from him? She could be the future England manager right there.\"She's got the playing credentials and she's obviously progressing through her coaching badges as well.\"Should Neville be appointed England manager, it would be his first managerial role, having previously been on the coaching staff with England U21s, Manchester United and Valencia."
