  "content": "The two clubs have settled on a £19.1m [€22m] fee which will see Carrillo make the switch to the Premier League.Southampton have made clear their desire to add a forward during the January transfer window and manager Mauricio Pellegrino earmarked Carrillo as his primary striking target.As reported by Sky Sports, Saints had a £17.6m offer for the 26-year-old rejected by Monaco earlier in the week.However, the reigning French champions are now willing to sanction the deal.Pellegrino previously worked with Carrillo in his native Argentina and rates the forward highly.Carrillo has made 22 appearances this season but just two of them have been starts in Ligue 1. He has scored 20 goals in over 50 appearances for Monaco since signing from Estudiantes in 2015.Saints have money to spend following the £75m sale of centre-back Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool, although the fee is to be paid in instalments over the period of his contract."
