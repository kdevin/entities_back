  "content": "The 23 year-old has joined on a permanent deal until the end of the 2018/19 season, subject to international clearance, after two-and-a-half years at the Bundesliga side.Bruenker, who will wear the number 21 shirt for the Bantams, trained with the League One side on Thursday ahead of their home fixture against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.The club have brought in Bruenker to provide back-up for striker Charlie Wyke, who has 13 goals in all competitions this season.Bradford boss Stuart McCall warned clubs earlier this week that Wyke was not for sale, unless an offer of Â£5m came in.\"Charlie is an important player and we don't want to over-work him if we can avoid it,\" the club's head of recruitment Greg Abbott told Bradford's official website.\"Kai is another physical option for us in attack. We have sometimes struggled in that department, especially when Charlie has been out through injury.\"Kai in his own right has to come into the building, develop his game and prove that he can claim a place in the team on merit.\"He is extremely excited to get started - he has a fantastic attitude.\""
