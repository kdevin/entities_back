  "description": "Former Rangers defender Jimmy Nicholl has returned to Ibrox as the club's new assistant manager.",
  "content": "The 61-year-old, who also played for Manchester United and Northern Ireland among others, had two spells at Rangers during the 1980s.His first was during the 1983-84 season, before spending three years (1986-89) in Glasgow when Graeme Souness was manager.Nicholl becomes Graeme Murty's right-hand man, having left an identical role under Paul Hartley at Scottish Championship club Falkirk.For the past two years, he has combined his club roles with a job as Northern Ireland's assistant manager under Michael O'Neill.Nicholl told the Rangers website: \"I have the opportunity to go back to Rangers in this capacity as assistant manager with Graeme Murty.\"I am so excited and chuffed to bits that Graeme has given me this opportunity. Paul Hartley gave me an opportunity at Falkirk, and I'm disappointed to be leaving them in the same position as we arrived.\"I would like to thank Paul and Falkirk for allowing me to take this opportunity.\"As a player, Nicholl won an FA Cup winners' medal at Old Trafford, along with three Scottish League titles with the Gers during the late 1980s.Nicholl has also managed Raith Rovers - guiding them to a League Cup final victory over Celtic in 1995 - as well as Millwall and Cowdenbeath and been assistant to Jimmy Calderwood at Dunfermline, Aberdeen and Kilmarnock.He will jet out to United States this weekend ahead of a training camp and two games against Brazilian opposition in the Florida Cup."
