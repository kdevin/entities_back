  "description": "Maxi Gomez was Celta Vigo's match-winner as they came from behind to beat Real Sociedad 2-1.",
  "content": "Sociedad took a 10th-minute lead when striker Willian Jose headed home Xabi Prieto's cross, although the visitors were soon back on level terms courtesy of Iago Aspas' penalty after Juanmi had been adjudged to have handled.The home side had a chance to restore their lead when they too were awarded a penalty for midfielder Stanislav Lobotka's challenge on Sergio Canales, but Jose hit the bar from the spot.Celta took full advantage of their escape 15 minutes from time when frontman Gomez snatched victory with a header from Daniel Wass' cross.In Sunday's early kick-off, Alaves threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Leganes.After a goalless first half, Munir El Haddadi opened the scoring in the 47th minute after good work from John Guidetti.Swede Guidetti again provided the assist for Alfonso Pedraza to double the home side's advantage shortly afterwards.Leganes were awarded a penalty in the 74th minute which was converted by Gabriel, and after Alaves defender Rodrigo Ely was shown a second yellow card, the visitors snatched an 88th-minute equaliser through Joseba Zaldua.",
