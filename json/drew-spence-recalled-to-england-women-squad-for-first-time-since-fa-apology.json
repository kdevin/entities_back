  "description": "Drew Spence has been recalled to the England Women squad for the first time since being subjected to \"discriminatory remarks on the grounds of race\" by former head coach Mark Sampson.",
  "content": "The FA \"sincerely apologised\" to both Spence and Chelsea team-mate Eni Aluko in October after evidence emerged about Sampson's remarks, which he denied, but FA chairman Greg Clarke admitted the organisation had breached its duty of care to the players.Spence returns for England's 10-day training camp in La Manga in Spain, before they resume their 2019 World Cup qualifying campaign against Wales at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium in April.Mo Marley, who remains in her role as interim head coach while the FA continue the process of appointing Sampson's permanent replacement, has also recalled Gilly Flaherty, Rachel Daly and Ellen White to the 30-player squad.\"The camp will give us extra time to do some concentrated work on specific areas we have prioritised,\" said Marley.\"After a well-earned break and time off in December, players will be ready to push on and prepare for the SheBelieves Cup, a tournament with outstanding teams where we will need to be at our best, and everyone will want to be a part of this.\"La Manga is crucial for our preparation and an ideal opportunity for players to compete for selection.\""
