  "description": "Chelsea target Edin Dzeko grabbed a late 1-1 draw for Roma at Sampdoria on Wednesday.",
  "content": "Roma sporting director Monchi had earlier denied a deal had been reached with Chelsea over the sale of Bosnia striker Dzeko.The 31-year-old showed his worth when he nodded in a crucial injury-time goal to grab a point after Fabio Quagliarella's penalty had given Sampdoria the lead just before the break.Lazio closed the gap on Serie A's top two to seven points following a comfortable 3-0 home win against Udinese.The Biancocelesti led 1-0 at half-time through Udinese defender Samir's own goal and added further strikes in the second period through Nani and Felipe Anderson.Simone Inzaghi's side extended their unbeaten league run to six matches to edge closer to leaders Napoli and Juventus, while they moved three points clear of Inter Milan in the race for the final Champions League slot.Samir headed Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's cross past his own goalkeeper in the 22nd minute and Nani's low finish doubled Lazio's lead soon after the interval.Anderson, who provided the cross for Nani's effort, completed the scoring late in the game after running on to Senad Lulic's through ball."
