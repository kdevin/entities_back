  "description": "West Brom's long wait for a Premier League win finally ended as Brighton were beaten 2-0 at The Hawthorns.",
  "content": "Jonny Evans' early header set Albion on their way to halting a 20-game winless run in the league stretching back to August, with fellow defender Craig Dawson heading in a second goal at the start of the second half.The result will also have been a weight off Alan Pardew's shoulders as it gave him that elusive first league victory since he took over as manager nine matches ago at the start of December.While it was not enough to lift West Brom out of the relegation zone, coming on the back of last weekend's FA Cup win at Exeter Pardew will hope it further raises confidence with tough games against Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea coming up in the next month.Meanwhile, Brighton's woeful away form continues to see them slide down the table and Chris Hughton's team are now just three points clear of the bottom three, four in front of West Brom, after a sixth successive goalless game on the road - a run which includes five defeats.Hit play on the video at the top of the page to watch the match highlights."
