  "description": "Tim Sherwood believed Serge Aurier fouled Manuel Lanzini in the build-up to Tottenham's equalising goal - but would VAR have ruled it out?",
  "content": "Heung-Min Son fired home a deserved equaliser for Spurs with one of the goals of the season, but Aurier's scissor tackle in the build-up on Lanzini could have been deemed a foul.VAR's are used to help the referee determine whether an infringement was made that should result in the goal not being awarded - and if it was in use at Wembley, then the goal could have been ruled out if the officials deemed the tackle in breach of the laws.Sherwood, who was working for Sky Sports as a pundit alongside Joe Cole, thought Aurier's tackle was a foul but remained unsure whether the goal would have been chalked off if the VAR was in use.Sherwood said: \"I think it's a foul - he gets the ball but he's endangering the opponent. I said it was a foul and Joe Cole didn't so we've all got different opinions.\"VAR is only to be used \"to correct clear errors and for missed serious incidents\" in those \"match-changing\" situations.It will be trialled in around 20 games between now and the end of this season, including for both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final between Arsenal and Chelsea later this month, live on Sky Sports.Hit the video to see whether Aurier's tackle should have been deemed a foul."
