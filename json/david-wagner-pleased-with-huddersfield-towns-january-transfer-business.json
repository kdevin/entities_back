  "description": "Huddersfield manager David Wagner says he was pleased with his business in the January transfer window ahead of their game at Manchester United on Saturday.",
  "content": "Wagner brought in winger Alex Pritchard from Norwich and defender Terence Kongolo on loan from Monaco to strengthen his squad as they continue their Premier League survival fight.\"This was our idea, to strengthen the squad, even if everybody knows how difficult it is, especially for a club like us,\" he said.\"I think we bettered our group, with [Alex] Pritchard and [Terence ] Kongolo, two positions which we really needed.\"Martin Cranie and Joe Lolley left us shortly before the window closed. This makes sense for us.\"Everybody knows we have a big challenge in front of us, we need players who are 100 per cent committed.\"They had good opportunities to move on and I totally respect their decisions.\"We now know which group of players will take this big challenge we have in front of us from a good starting point to try and make another miracle happen and stay in the Premier League.\"Huddersfield have not won in their last seven league games but they defeated United 2-1 in the reverse fixture at the John Smith's Stadium in October and Wagner is undaunted by their trip to Old Trafford.\"If you have done it once you know the impossible is possible in football,\" he added. \"You have to be on it and have the desire and belief you can get something out of the game.\"What we cannot influence we have to accept but our desire, spirit and belief, this is what we have to bring out on the grass.\"It is important we have belief rather than dreams. We will try everything to steal something from this game. We are so excited about this event, there are not a lot of better occasions in the football world.\"Wagner remains confident for the rest of the campaign and was keen to emphasise how they are defying expectations by sitting higher in the league table, one point and one place outside the relegation zone ahead of the weekend's fixtures, than many people thought they would.\"Why shouldn't we be positive? At the start of the season everyone thought after 25 games Huddersfield would be bottom of the table with maybe 15 points,\" he said.\"Now we are one of the teams fighting for survival. No one likes defeats, but we are positive because we are fighting, something no one expected.\"Nobody expects anything from us so we can take this game with total freedom.\"",
