  "description": "Stoke City have sacked manager Mark Hughes following their FA Cup third-round defeat to League Two side Coventry City on Saturday.",
  "content": "The 2-1 defeat came on the back of a terrible run of form in the Premier League, with Stoke winning just two of their previous 12 matches.A statement on the club's Twitter feed said: \"Stoke City can confirm that the contract of manager Mark Hughes has been terminated with immediate effect.\"We would like to thank Mark for all he has achieved for the club over the last four and a half years, notably in guiding us to three successive ninth places finishes in the Premier League, and we wish him every success for the future.\"The club will look to appoint a new manager as soon as possible and will be making no further comment at this time.\"Sky Sports News reported on Wednesday that Stoke's board were considering Hughes' future, with the side lying 18th in the table.The Welshman faced a backlash after resting several first-team regulars for Stoke's trip to Chelsea - which they lost 5-0 - ahead of their meeting with fellow strugglers Newcastle.However, Hughes' side went on to lose that game as well, and the result was met with a chorus of boos and chants of \"Hughes out\".He later walked out of his post-match press conference, not long after being asked about the threat to his position and replying: \"Who else is going to do it?\"Sky sources understand that former Everton boss Ronald Koeman would not be interested in the position.Hughes had been in charge at the Potteries club since May 2013, when he took over from Tony Pulis.Stoke are not in Premier League action again until January 15 when they travel to Manchester United on Monday Night Football."
