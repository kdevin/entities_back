  "content": "The 20-year-old moves to Ashton Gate on a two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee.The midfielder will not be available to play in the weekend's FA Cup tie against Watford, but can face Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-final next week.\"He's a brilliant player, who can come in and compete immediately. Hopefully he can improve and he improves us,\" manager Lee Johnson told City's website.\"I think Liam gives us something slightly different to what we have already and adds to the qualities we already have in midfield.\"He loves getting on the ball and is a very good passer with both his left and right foot.\"He's done very well on loan at Yeovil Town previously and I've tracked him for some time.\"Walsh did not make an appearance for Everton's first team, but made three loan appearances for Birmingham earlier this campaign."
