Ipswich are one of them and I'm thankful for the chance to come and play here.\"\nCarter-Vickers - a USA youth international - is a product of the Spurs academy and one that boss Mauricio Pochettino has been keen to develop.\nHe was on the periphery of the first team last season but Spurs signed two new South American centre-backs in the summer in club-record Davinson Sanchez and 20-year-old Juan Foyth.\nCarter-Vickers has made four appearances in cup competitions for Tottenham but never played a match in the Premier League.\nHe becomes the Tractor Boys' first signing of the January window, and they are yet to allow anyone to leave Portman Road.\n",
