  "description": "Tottenham centre-back Cameron Carter-Vickers has joined Ipswich Town on loan for the rest of the season.",
  "content": "The 20-year-old was recently recalled from a loan at Championship side Sheffield United despite making 17 league starts under Chris Wilder.He said: \"I didn't expect to be called back. I thought I would be at Sheffield for the season but then I got told Ipswich wanted me.\"It's all happened very quickly but I know Ipswich are a big club and it's an exciting opportunity for me.\"I looked at the Championship table and Ipswich are only four points off the play-offs so hopefully I can help the team push on and compete for the top six places.\"I've really enjoyed Championship football. It's a demanding league and there are a lot of big clubs in the division. Ipswich are one of them and I'm thankful for the chance to come and play here.\"Carter-Vickers - a USA youth international - is a product of the Spurs academy and one that boss Mauricio Pochettino has been keen to develop.He was on the periphery of the first team last season but Spurs signed two new South American centre-backs in the summer in club-record Davinson Sanchez and 20-year-old Juan Foyth.Carter-Vickers has made four appearances in cup competitions for Tottenham but never played a match in the Premier League.He becomes the Tractor Boys' first signing of the January window, and they are yet to allow anyone to leave Portman Road."
