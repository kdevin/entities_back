Tweet @SkySportsPL with #TylersTeasers and don't forget to have a go at his latest teaser.Martin's starting stats...After a weekend of FA Cup football, we are looking forward to the return of the Premier League after a hectic Christmas. It started live on Sky Sports on Friday, December 22 with Arsenal's thrilling 3-3 draw with Liverpool and finished with two spectacular goals at Wembley two weeks later as Tottenham drew 1-1 with West Ham. A total of 40 games in 14 days.This is how the teams did in the festive mini league. Tottenham, Liverpool and Man City all picked 10 points from a possible 12, while West Brom, Everton, Southampton and Burnley all got two points.West Brom haven't won since the start of the season. How far are they from a Premier League record? Kim, DudleyMARTIN SAYS: West Brom are now winless in 20 Premier League games, since their wins over Bournemouth and Burnley on the first two weekends of the campaign.Only three clubs have ever had a longer winless run in the competition, but two of those have come spread over different seasons.Norwich went 21 games without a win between April 1995, when they were relegated to the second tier, and November 2004, when they beat Southampton having been promoted back to the Premier League after a nine-year absence.Sunderland were in the same boat as they went 26 games without a win between December 2002 and September 2005, before beating Middlesbrough, but as is often the case with these types of questions, Derby's class of 2007/08 are way out in front.They are technically still winless in 32 Premier League games, after registering just one victory that season against Newcastle on September 27.Of course, Derby are hoping they can end that run in 2018, as they are in with a good shout of promotion back to the Premier League.Everton haven't had a shot on target in three Premier League games this season. Is that a record? Elliott, MerseysideMARTIN SAYS: The 2-0 defeat to Manchester United on New Year's Day was indeed the third time this season Everton have failed to register a shot on target. They also failed to trouble the goalkeeper in both of their matches against Chelsea this season (a 0-0 draw at home and a 2-0 defeat away).However, it's not a record. It's not even the most this season. Swansea have already played four Premier League matches this season without a shot on target.Burnley, Huddersfield, Crystal Palace and Watford are not far behind, having played in two matches this season without a shot on target.Last season, no side finished the campaign without a shot on target in more than two matches. Everton, Burnley, Hull, Middlesbrough and Southampton all failed to have a shot on target twice.It's not necessarily a bad thing, however. Quite incredibly, last season two sides actually recorded victories without having a shot on target: Watford beat Hull 1-0 in October with Michael Dawson's own goal, and in March last year, Crystal Palace beat Watford 1-0 thanks to Troy Deeney's own goal.That represents half of the occasions it has happened in the division since Opta's record began in 2003/04; Middlesbrough beating Man City in November 2003 and Sunderland beating West Brom in January 2006 without a shot on target.Liverpool are unbeaten in 16 games in all competitions. What's their record in the Premier League era? Steve, LondonMARTIN SAYS: In the 16 games since the 4-1 defeat by Tottenham in October, Liverpool have tightened up in defence, conceding just 13 goals, winning 11 games and drawing five.If they can go just another five games without defeat, they will break a club record of 21 games unbeaten in the Premier League era - although their record faces a stiff test on Super Sunday against runaway leaders Man City at Anfield.Liverpool went 21 matches unbeaten between November 1995 and March 1996 when losses at Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest sandwiched their longest unbeaten run (all competitions) in the Premier League era.If they avoid defeat on Sunday, they can equal that record if they go unbeaten against Swansea (Premier League), West Brom (FA Cup), Huddersfield (Premier League) and Tottenham (Premier League, live on Sky Sports). They could potentially break it in their next game - either an FA Cup replay with West Brom or a Premier League trip to Southampton.Liverpool's best ever unbeaten run in all competitions came between March and September 1982, when they went 25 games without a defeat (20 wins, five draws).Petr Cech has never saved a penalty during his time at Arsenal. Does anybody have a worse penalty record since he joined? Liam, HertsMARTIN SAYS: You're not wrong, Liam. Each of the 14 penalties Petr Cech has faced in the Premier League with Arsenal have been scored, and that's going back to the start of the 2015/16 season. No goalkeeper has conceded more penalties in that time.Of goalkeepers that have faced more than five penalties in that time, only four others have failed to make a save. David de Gea and David Marshall have conceded seven out of seven, Jack Butland has conceded all six he has faced and Ben Foster has conceded five.Of goalkeepers who have faced five or more penalties, Artur Boruc has the best record, saving four and conceding only five of the nine spot kicks faced since August 2015. That means he's saved 44 per cent of Premier League penalties faced in that time. Simon Mignolet has saved four out of 10 in that time (40 per cent).Only two goalkeepers have faced more penalties at a single club than Cech without saving one. Brad Friedel (Aston Villa) and Craig Gordon (Sunderland) both faced 15 and didn't make a save."
