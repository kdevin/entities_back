  "description": "Gary Rowett is poised to sign a new contract at Derby County that will end speculation linking him with Stoke City, Sky Sports News understands.",
  "content": "Rowett was installed as one of the favourites to replace Mark Hughes and SSN were told he was on Stoke's shortlist of candidates.But Derby have moved quickly to secure their manager after he took them to second place in the Championship table.Rowett has 18 months left on his existing deal, which is understood to have a release clause in it, so long as any potential suitor was to pay more than £1.5m in compensation.It's thought the new deal has much tighter terms, giving Derby owner Mel Morris much more confidence that his prize asset won't be prised away for the Premier League, while also giving Rowett a significant pay rise.Martin O'Neill is the bookies' favourite for the manager's job at the Bet365 Stadium but he is still contracted to the Football Association of Ireland and has verbally agreed an extension until beyond the 2020 European Championships.",
