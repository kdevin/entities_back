  "description": "Paris Saint-Germain made light of Neymar's absence in beating Guingamp 4-2 to secure their ticket to the French Cup last 16 on Wednesday as Edinson Cavani was made to wait for his club-record goal.",
  "content": "Despite PSG's dominance, Cavani failed to get on the scoresheet as he pursues a record 157th goal, but it was not for the want of trying as he failed to convert a hatful of chances.The Uruguay striker is on the verge of becoming PSG's all-time scorer after drawing level with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's benchmark in the 8-0 rout of Dijon last week.Neymar left the pitch after that Ligue 1 outing angered at booing directed at him from Parc des Princes fans when he stepped up to take a penalty rather than allowing Cavani a shot at the record. The world's most expensive player was missing from PSG's 2-1 loss at Lyon on Sunday and again for this cup tie.Another high profile absentee was Kylian Mbappe, who was stretchered off after a clash with Lyon's Anthony Lopes.Elsewhere, Lyon edged Monaco 3-2. Stevan Jovetic opened the scoring for Monaco but Bertrand Traore quickly levelled with Mariano Diaz hitting a double. Rony Lopes gave Monaco hope but Lyon held on.Elsewhere, Montpellier beat Lorient 4-3, Les Herbiers won 2-1 at Saint-Lo Manche and Troyes, Grenoble and Metz all progressed on penalties."
