  "description": "Arsenal might be without club-record signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when they host Everton on Saturday.",
  "content": "Aubameyang joined the Gunners on Deadline Day in a £60m deal from Borussia Dortmund, but has been hit with a sickness bug that could rule him out this weekend.\"I have to assess how well he is physically today and how well he feels,\" said manager Arsene Wenger on Friday. \"He had a fever, so he could not practice a lot. He started yesterday, but was still not completely well.\"I have to assess with the medical department how fit he can be.\"Another January signing, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, is set to make his first Arsenal start after coming off the bench in the 3-1 midweek defeat to Swansea.Everton ended a seven-match winless run with a 2-1 victory over Leicester on Wednesday. Theo Walcott, who joined from Arsenal in January, scored both goals for the Toffees,Looking ahead to the trip to the Emirates, Everton boss Sam Allardyce said: \"It's about nullifying the strengths of Arsenal. Defensively they're weak because of the amount of players they commit forward. If we can use the ball cleverly and make the right runs on the attack we can hurt them.\"While Aubameyang may have to wait for his Arsenal debut, Jack Wilshere has also been ill and could be sidelined.Danny Welbeck (hip) and Santi Cazorla (Achilles) remain absent for the Gunners.Everton's new on-loan defender Eliaquim Mangala could be involved after joining from Manchester City.Allardyce may decide to rest Seamus Coleman after his first appearance in 319 days after a double leg fracture, while midfielder James McCarthy is in the early stages of rehabilitation from a similar injury.Arsenal are unbeaten in 23 home matches against Everton in all competitions (W19 D4) since a 2-1 Premier League defeat in January 1996 under Bruce Rioch.Everton have played more Premier League matches at the Emirates without winning (11 - W0 D4 L7) than any other club.Arsenal have never lost a Premier League game at the Emirates in the month of February (P21 W17 D4 L0), with their last home defeat coming against West Ham at Highbury in February 2006.Arsenal have made the most errors leading to goals in Europe's big five leagues this season (11).This match is Sam Allardyce's 500th in the Premier League, making him just the fifth manager to achieve this. Of the previous four, only Arsene Wenger won his 500th match in charge (Harry Redknapp drew, Alex Ferguson and David Moyes lost).Arsenal new signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a hand in 172 goals in 213 matches in all competitions for Dortmund (141 goals, 31 assists), averaging a goal or assist every 96 minutes.In attack, it's been a really positive window for Arsenal, however, they still need defenders. The Bournemouth and the Swansea results will keep cropping up until the end of the season with the defence they have. However, I expect them to beat Everton at the Emirates. It's Theo Walcott's return and he got two goals in midweek but I can't see anything other than a home win. Their home form has been in stark contrast to their away form and you'd expect Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan to play. If they do I'm expecting a comfortable win for Arsene Wenger and his side.PAUL PREDICTS: 3-0 (7/1 with Sky Bet)",
