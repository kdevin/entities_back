  "description": "Diego Costa was sent off in his first La Liga appearance since returning to Atletico Madrid after picking up a second yellow card for his celebrations after scoring in a 2-0 win over Getafe.",
  "content": "Former Chelsea striker Costa doubled Atletico's lead at the Wanda Metropolitano when he slotted home a low cross from the right in the 68th minute.The Spain international then rushed off to celebrate in among the Atletico fans behind the goal, but when he returned to the pitch he was shown a second yellow card by the referee.Costa, who only minutes before had been booked for raising his arms while being challenged by Djene Dakonam, looked bemused at the official's decision and stood still for a while, but in the end had no choice but to exit the pitch.Costa's goal was his second in two matches for Atletico, having also netted in the 4-0 Copa del Rey win over Lleida in midweek. That was his first appearance since returning to the club from Chelsea last summer, with the Spanish side unable to register any new players until this month due to a FIFA-imposed transfer ban.The 29-year-old almost notched another early on in Saturday's derby - his first La Liga game since 2014 - with a long-range effort that fizzed just over.Costa then set up Antoine Griezmann for a shot that went narrowly wide before the France international played in Angel Correa to open the scoring in the 18th minute, the Argentine firing past Damian Martinez with the outside of his foot.Getafe had chances to net themselves, with Angel Rodriguez fluffing an attempted lob when the game was goalless and Amath Diedhiou wasting a chance to equalise, but Costa's second-half strike left them with too big a mountain to climb - even with the combative striker's early bath."
