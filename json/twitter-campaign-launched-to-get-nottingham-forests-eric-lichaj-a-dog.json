  "description": "Nottingham Forest players and supporters have started a social media campaign to help Eric Lichaj get a dog after the defender revealed he had fallen one goal short of earning a pet in the FA Cup victory over Arsenal. ",
  "content": "The American, who has played at the City Ground since 2013, scored twice in Forest's 4-2 victory over Arsene Wenger's side on Sunday and said in a post-match interview that his wife had promised him a dog if he scored a hat-trick this season.\nLichaj took to Twitter on Monday morning, asking \"anyone who is bored\" to send \"dog pics, memes, gifs\" to @KatPerko - his wife's Twitter handle - and plenty of users joined in using the hashtag #GetEricADog.\nTeam-mates, including Kieran Dowell, who scored the penalty for Forest's fourth when Lichaj could have completed an unlikely treble, responded by posting a GIF of a beagle flying on a magic carpet.\nVarious other teammates joined in the light-hearted fun, with Ben Brereton, Zach Clough, Joe Worrall and Matty Cash among those to post dog-related videos on Monday.\nLater on Monday evening Lichaj's wife, Kathryn Lichaj, posted on Twitter: \"Cannot take looking at anymore pictures or videos of dogs.\n\"Ok guys, you and @EricLichaj win! I said we will look into it... please no more pictures of dogs!!\"\nLichaj will be out of contract at the end of the season and was understood to be in talks about a new deal prior to Mark Warburton's sacking as manager, but he has yet to commit his future to the Championship side.\nAcademy boss Gary Brazil, in charge of first-team affairs until the club appoint a new manager, hopes Forest, who face Aston Villa on Saturday, live on Sky Sports Football, keep hold of the 29-year-old.\n\"He is not a player this club would want to lose. You do not want to lose good players, do you?\" Brazil said.\n\"Whatever age they are, you want to keep good players at a club and secure at the club so that they enable you to push on.\"\n",
