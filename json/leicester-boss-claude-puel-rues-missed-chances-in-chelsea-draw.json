  "title": "Leicester boss Claude Puel rues missed chances in Chelsea draw",
  "description": "Claude Puel said it was \"crazy\" that Leicester failed to take any of their chances in a 0-0 draw with Chelsea on Saturday.",
  "content": "The Foxes dominated for most of the match in west London and went close in the first half through Riyad Mahrez, Wilfred Ndidi and Jamie Vardy.Ben Chilwell's 68th-minute dismissal allowed Chelsea to ease the pressure on them, but the hosts created few clear openings and Puel felt his side deserved more than just a point.\"Of course it's a good reward after playing 10 against 11 at the end,\" he told Sky Sports. \"But we deserved the point and perhaps more with all the chances we had.\"In the first half it was crazy not to find the possibility to score. They have had some opportunities but with all the good moves we make on the pitch, with quality and good chances...It's a little disappointment because we had a lot of chances without finding the clinical edge, but it's good for the confidence.\"While Leicester might have deserved to win, the draw continues a good recent record against top-six sides that has also seen them beat Tottenham and hold Manchester United.\"It's a good feeling after this game with the quality we showed in the game and it's important to continue like this for the next games,\" said Puel.\"I think it's important to keep a good ambition against any opponent. It's a good feeling and it was important to play like this.\"Asked about Chilwell's red, which was shown for two quick bookings, Puel said: \"Very harsh. It was not a good balance with the yellow card, we conceded a lot of yellow cards and it was not the same for the other team.\"It was not a good balance and the sending off shows the difficulty with the yellow card because it was difficult after that to finish the game.\"Puel also discussed transfer speculation around Mahrez, adding: \"There is a lot of speculation about our players, about Riyad and other players, but of course we want to keep our best players. That's the most important thing for us.\"He is happy with his team-mates and us and of course all the things are just speculation.\"",
