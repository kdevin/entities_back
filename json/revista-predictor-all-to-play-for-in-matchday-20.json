  "title": "Revista Predictor: All to play for in Matchday 20",
  "description": "After a perhaps surprisingly successful week for our pundits, the Revista Predictor is aiming to get its own back on LaLiga Matchday 20.  David Garrido explains...",
  "content": "Wow. I think we've got his back up, haven't we? The Predictor has deliberately decided to avoid teams in the top four and the bottom three after Rob Palmer stunned the audience (and maybe even himself) by guessing all three first goalscorers last weekend. Fair enough, we like a challenge - game on.It's an eventful time for both these teams - if reports are to be believed, Quique Sánchez Flores had agreed to become the new Stoke boss before then having a change of heart and staying at Espanyol who are in good form after beating Barcelona in midweek.Sevilla's new coach Vincenzo Montella has suffered disappointing defeats at home to Real Betis and away at Alavés, before then beating Atlético in the Copa del Rey, bringing a 2-1 lead back to the Sánchez Pizjuán next week.All three match outcomes are covered here, with myself and Jon Driscoll saying the home side will make it four wins in five in all competitions, Rob going the other way, and Keatings and Phillips forecasting a draw. Three of us have gone for Gerard Moreno to open the scoring - he's got eight goals and counting, five of those coming in his last seven games.Well, not much to see here if you're a Levante fan. Each and every one of the so-called \"experts\" have backed Villarreal to win comfortably, and with a clean sheet.The question is, who will break the deadlock? Backing Carlos Bacca could be where the smart money is, otherwise myself and Predictor standings leader Keatings have gone for the increasingly impressive Pablo Fornals.After their recent drop, there's been a little upsurge in form from the Yellow Submarine - since a third defeat in a row in La Liga came at home to Barcelona, they've gone unbeaten in the next four games, winning three, including a memorable, historic first win at the Bernabéu against Real Madrid. For Levante, their only league win in the last 14 games was against lowly Las Palmas, and that game in mid-November was actually the last time one of their own players scored.Alavés have managed to just about climb out of the relegation zone, and this represents a real chance to get themselves further away from the bottom three in La Liga. The last time they won away was at Real Valladolid in the Copa del Rey in late October, losing six of their next seven games on the road.Still, there's a fair bit of fence-sitting here from the pundits, with four of the five predicting it will finish honours even, and if Palmer and Keatings' 0-0 predictions come in, then it's a maximum 10 points to them both!Only Phillips is dissenting, instead backing the hosts for another victory in Vitoria - he and Kevin reckon Munir will be first goalscorer here.We had a change to the standings last week with Rob Palmer storming up to second place, but can he stay there?The first game of our tricky trio kicks off at 12pm GMT on Saturday, so that's your deadline to get involved with your predictions - tweet us @SkyRevista and don't forget to use the hashtag #RevistaPredictor. Buena suerte!",
