I obviously know Scholesy really well. We will see what happens.\"\nGiggs continued: \"It is a balance. A balance about getting experience, fresh ideas - someone who can improve the Welsh team.\n\"It is my first job (in management), so if you have someone with experience, it is a bonus.\n\"We are getting there (with coaching team). Nothing concrete at the moment - only Tony Roberts as goalkeeper coach who will carry on, someone I know well from my playing career with Wales.\n",
