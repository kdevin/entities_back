  "description": "West Ham will listen to offers for Javier Hernandez during the January transfer window, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "The former Manchester United forward was signed for Â£16m from Bayer Leverkusen last summer but has only managed four Premier League goals so far.Hernandez last found the net during a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on 28 October.Hammers manager David Moyes appears to be keen on re-shaping the club's attack and a fee has already been agreed for the sale of Diafra Sakho to Crystal Palace.Sky sources understand West Ham would also be willing to sell forwards Andre Ayew and Andy Carroll if the right price was offered.Moyes took charge at West Ham at the start of November following the dismissal of Slaven Bilic and has managed to lift the club out of the drop zone - they lie 15th ahead of Saturday's trip to Huddersfield.The experienced Hernandez, who has 99 caps for Mexico, has continued to feature under the new manager but is struggling for goals and the Hammers are apparently willing to part company with the 29-year-old.And Sky Sports News also understands that Krasnodar striker Fyodor Smolov, the captain of the Russian national team, could be on his way to east London this month."
