  "title": "Harry Kane's 100 Premier League goals for Tottenham - the stats behind them",
  "description": "Harry Kane scored his 100th Premier League goal from the penalty spot during Tottenham's 2-2 draw at Liverpool on Sunday, reaching the milestone in just 141 appearances.",
  "content": "Only Alan Shearer has hit triple figures in fewer appearances during the modern era, netting his century from 124 appearances more than 20 years ago.\nIn total, 27 players have scored 100 Premier League goals or more, with Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero entering the elite club after only 147 appearances, followed by Thierry Henry (160 apps), Ian Wright (173) and Robbie Fowler (175).\n\nAndre Villas-Boas handed Kane his Premier League debut as an 86th-minute substitute during a 2-1 defeat to Newcastle on the opening day of 2012/13, but, weeks later, he joined Norwich on loan.\nThere, Kane earned his first Premier League start on New Year's Day, but suffered a metatarsal injury on his second run-out and only made two more league appearances for the Canaries that term before joining Leicester on loan in the Championship.\nHaving returned to Spurs for the start of 2013/14, the Englishman netted his first Premier League goal late in the season, during a 5-1 thrashing over Sunderland in April, and also scored in the following two games.\nHe started 2014/15 on the sidelines but grabbed the match-winner as a 60th-minute substitute at Aston Villa in November - a watershed moment that led to a run of 71 uninterrupted Premier League starts.\nThat initial breakthrough season also saw Roy Hodgson hand Kane his first England cap in March, replacing captain Wayne Rooney as a substitute and scoring within two minutes to seal a 4-0 win over Lithuania.\nHaving ended that season on 21 league goals, Kane won the Golden Boot with 25 goals in 2016/17, and claimed it again with 29 last season.\nThis season, Kane has found the back of the net 22 times to date, becoming only the third player to score more than 20 Premier League goals in four consecutive seasons - matching Alan Shearer and behind only Thierry Henry's five-season run between 2001/02 and 2005/06.\nHe has hit eight hat-tricks in the Premier League over the last four seasons - including a four-goal haul in the 6-1 goal fest at Leicester last year - one matchball shy of Robbie Fowler's nine and three behind Shearer's all-time record of 11.\nIn addition, Kane has entered the 100 club at just 24 years old - 10 months younger than Shearer was when he hit the 100 milestone in December, 1995.\nShearer proceeded to set the all-time record of 260 Premier League goals, and - if Spurs can stave off interest from suitors such as Real Madrid - Kane is well on course to smash the long-standing record.\n",
