  "content": "The 28-year-old has been widely linked with a move to Inter Milan, while Spanish side Sevilla have also made contact with Liverpool over a loan move for the England international.Sturridge has struggled for first-team action this season under Klopp, with Roberto Firmino largely preferred up front for the Reds.Sky sources understand Inter Milan remain strongly interested in signing the 28-year-old, who has scored 63 goals in 133 appearances for the Reds since joining from Chelsea in 2013.Inter are understood to want a loan deal, with an option to buy, but they are not willing to pay the €40m (£35m) Liverpool want to make the move permanent, according to Sky in Italy.While there is no deal in place at this time, it is believed the decision to stay or leave Anfield now lies with Sturridge, who still has 18 months left on his contract with the Reds.",
