  "title": "Leicester boss Claude Puel still in the dark over Riyad Mahrez return",
  "description": "Claude Puel insisted Riyad Mahrez was not at the forefront of his thoughts following a frustrating afternoon for the Leicester City boss.",
  "content": "The Foxes were held to a 1-1 draw at the King Power Stadium, where having led through Jamie Vardy's goal, they then lacked the guile and craft so often provided by Mahrez once Federico Fernandez had headed Swansea level early in the second half.Mahrez, who also missed the defeat at Everton, has not been seen by the club since his proposed move to Manchester City collapsed on Wednesday.Asked when he expected the former Player of the Year to return to the Leicester squad, Puel said: \"I expect nothing. The most important thing is not to think about one player, but to think about my team and my squad.\"Today, just after the game, Riyad is not my preoccupation. My preoccupation is about my available players and to keep them in a positive attitude and to continue this good work.\"My only feelings are about my available players and as for Riyad we will see later.\"It looked like Mahrez might not be missed as Leicester played some lovely football during the first half and took the lead after 17 minutes through Vardy.Fousseni Diabate and Kelechi Iheanacho had chances to extend the lead before half-time before Swansea's first meaningful effort on goal ended up in the back of Leicester's net as the unmarked Fernandez headed in Ki Sung-yueng's corner from seven yards out after 53 minutes.\"It is big frustration this afternoon, Swansea defended very well,\" Puel said. \"We played very well, especially in the first half, against this team that has just had good results against Liverpool and Arsenal. They had just one chance in the game.\"We had quality and good combinations between the players but we missed the clinical edge. We needed another goal in the first half because this was a period of good quality and we had them under pressure. To concede the goal is harsh for the team.\"",
