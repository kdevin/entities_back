  "description": "Everton have given U23 coach David Unsworth permission to speak to Oxford United about their managerial vacancy, according to Sky sources.",
  "content": "The Us are looking for a new boss after sacking Pep Clotet during the January transfer window.Unsworth, 44, has been successful with the Toffees' youth team and also had a spell as Everton first-team boss earlier this season following the sacking of Ronald Koeman.This stint with the seniors was less successful however, losing five of his eight games in charge including heavy defeats to Southampton, Lyon and Atalanta.Under Unsworth, Everton's U23s won the 2016-17 Premier League 2 division title.He has been credited with a hand in the development of a number of players to have broken into the Everton first-team including Tom Davies, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jonjoe Kenny.Unsworth previously turned down the chance to manage Irish club Sligo Rovers in 2012 and Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock the following year.He has enjoyed coaching roles with Scotland, Preston North End and Sheffield United.",
