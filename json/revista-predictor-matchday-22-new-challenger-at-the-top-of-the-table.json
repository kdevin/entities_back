  "description": "Just as Barcelona's momentum was checked, could we have a new challenger to try and reel in Kevin Keatings on the #RevistaPredictor? David Garrido recaps Matchday 22 in La Liga...",
  "content": "Three games, in total 28 points won across the board. I mean it's not a brilliant tally, but we'll take it, and the main thing is that the leader hasn't got away. Here's a look at the trio of games...\nApproaching full-time, this match looked to be earning Jon Driscoll and David Phillips just a single point until Iago Aspas popped up to give Celta a consolation goal, and so that magically became four points to both of those pundits. Celta had been one of the form teams before this game, but Alavés played the counter-attack brilliantly and were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes. Abelardo really has breathed new life into this team, especially at home, to take them five points above the bottom three - and this is a team who lost their first six La Liga games of the season and nine of the first 10. For Celta, the defeat means Juan Carlos Unzue's side were unable to push into the European places but they're still there or thereabouts.\nQuite simply well played, Rob Palmer. The above scoreline with Gerard Moreno as first goalscorer was Rob's prediction, earning him the maximum 10 points from this game. Catalan derbies can be attritional, and this was no different, exacerbated by the monsoon conditions at the RCDE Stadium. Espanyol were just eight minutes away from a first home La Liga victory against Barcelona in 11 years when Gerard Pique headed home the equaliser to preserve Barca's unbeaten start to the league season - that aura of inevitability that they would get a result seems to have passed from Real Madrid to their great rivals. Nine points is the gap to second-placed Atletico now - it's still very much Barca's title to lose.\nBy saying Angel Correa would break the deadlock, it's a very valuable six points for David Phillips who'd been propping up the table for some time. No further goals scored and not much intensity from the visitors either...it feels like Valencia are shot after a sixth defeat in nine La Liga games, and their season now largely rests on their Copa del Rey semi-final where they need to overturn a 0-1 deficit against Barcelona back at Mestalla. The battle for Champions League places is very much in the balance with both Real Madrid and Villarreal on their tail. For Atletico, the unbeaten LaLiga run stretches to five games, four of them wins with clean sheets. Maybe Diego Simeone is seeing a few sparks from his side...\nThank you for your predictions on Twitter - those who did well all got Gerard Moreno as first goalscorer, so points awarded are as follows: @superkos 11 points, @alex_farrar seven points, @George__Njoroge six points.\nDon't forget to check @SkyRevista on Twitter on Friday, when we reveal the next trio of games on the #RevistaPredictor.\n",
