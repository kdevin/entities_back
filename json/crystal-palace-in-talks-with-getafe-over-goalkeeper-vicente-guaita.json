  "content": "The 30-year-old's contract expires at the end of the season, and Getafe are keen to get a fee - believed to be £3.5m - rather than lose him for nothing in the summer.Watford and Besiktas have also been linked with the 'keeper, who has conceded just 16 goals in 17 La Liga appearances this season.Guaita came through the ranks at Valencia before moving to Getafe - currently eighth in La Liga - in the summer of 2014.Roy Hodgson has alternated between Julian Speroni and Wayne Hennessey as his first-choice goalkeeper since arriving at the club in September.The Palace manager confirmed as far back as November that he was keen to sign a new goalkeeper in the January transfer window.He said: \"Everybody knows we've got two senior goalkeepers at the club, one of whom is 38 years of age so I think right from the very start of the season people have been saying that Crystal Palace need at least one more goalkeeper. So I don't think that's a great secret.\"",
