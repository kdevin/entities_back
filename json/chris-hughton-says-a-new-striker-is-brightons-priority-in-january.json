  "content": "Brighton have found the net just 17 times in 23 Premier League games this season - only bottom-placed Swansea have scored fewer times.Hughton admitted he tried to sign a striker last summer, and when asked if signing one this month was a priority, he replied: \"I think it has to be.\"We've had a bit of a difficult time of late, which is normal. Nobody expected an easy ride.\"We've found it difficult to get the goals we need, but that's down to a contribution from everyone in the team.\"We did try in the summer and we'll continue to do that.\"Hughton acknowledged he was also looking for a replacement for Izzy Brown, the Chelsea forward who has returned to parent club Chelsea after suffering a serious knee injury.As well as wanting to strengthen his side's attack, Hughton also said \"we are still trying to bring somebody in in the centre-half position\", despite Brighton having the seventh-best defensive record in the league.Brighton have had a quiet January so far, with no arrivals and just Jamie Murphy leaving on loan.However, that may soon change, as Hughton suggested one player, in particular, may be allowed to depart the club.He said: \"We're looking at the possibility of Connor Goldson going out on loan, who's a very good player.\"The 25-year-old defender has made only four appearances for Brighton this season, with just one of those coming in the Premier League."
