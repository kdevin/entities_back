  "content": "United secured back-to-back league wins at Turf Moor for the first time since 1963 but it was a first for Anthony Martial that will be of more interest to Jose Mourinho. The in-form Frenchman has now scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time, after failing to net in each of his previous six beforehand.The Gunners were four up halfway through the first half but it was the goal by Alexandre Lacazette that brought up a curious piece of history for Arsene Wenger's team. His strike was the 500th by French players for Arsenal in the Premier League era. That is 358 more goals by Frenchmen than any other side in the competition.It was not the best of afternoons for Sam Allardyce and his decision to replace Cenk Tosun with Oumar Niasse was not warmly received by the crowd but it brought quick results. Niasse scored just 56 seconds after coming off the bench, the fastest goal by a substitute in the Premier League this season and the player's fourth goal off the bench this term.Riyad Mahrez has now scored in each of his last five Premier League games against Watford but it was Jamie Vardy who got the opener after winning the penalty himself. Since the start of the 2014-15 season, Vardy has won 13 penalties for Leicester - more than any other player in the Premier League during this time.Javier Hernandez has not had an enjoyable season for West Ham and his side did not have things their own way in drawing 1-1 with Bournemouth, but the Mexican was at least back among the goals. His equaliser was the 42nd Premier League goal of his career, with every single one of them coming from inside the box.",
