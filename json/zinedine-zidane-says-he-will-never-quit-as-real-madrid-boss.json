I'm never going to throw in the towel. I'm going to continue fighting as I've always shown and I'm not going to quit ever. \"One positive for Zidane is the chance to finally be able to field his all-star forward line of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema against Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.The much-vaunted 'BBC' strikeforce have rarely been available at the same time over the last 10 months due to injuries and suspension, but they could be unleashed against Depor.\"The three of them are going to be with us, but I'm not going to say who will play. I'm very happy to be able to count on these three great players, they offer a lot to the team,\" said Zidane.Zidane, meanwhile, played down media speculation linking Madrid with another of the game's top forwards - PSG ace Neymar.He said of the world's most expensive player: \"I won't speak about players who aren't mine.
