  "content": "Following their FIFA World Club Cup victory in December, the Spanish side's season has threatened to fall apart.A 3-0 home mauling at the hands of Barcelona followed by a string of mediocre performances and results has sunk Madrid's title defence and seen them make heavy weather of progressing in the Copa del Rey.With a Champions League last-16 showdown against rampant Paris St Germain fast approaching, Madrid need to rediscover last year's form quickly or risk seeing their European title defence come to an end as well.Asked if he had considered quitting, the Frenchman told a press conference. \"I don't think about negative things, only positive.\"We will find positive things. I'm never going to throw in the towel. I'm going to continue fighting as I've always shown and I'm not going to quit ever. \"One positive for Zidane is the chance to finally be able to field his all-star forward line of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema against Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.The much-vaunted 'BBC' strikeforce have rarely been available at the same time over the last 10 months due to injuries and suspension, but they could be unleashed against Depor.\"The three of them are going to be with us, but I'm not going to say who will play. I'm very happy to be able to count on these three great players, they offer a lot to the team,\" said Zidane.Zidane, meanwhile, played down media speculation linking Madrid with another of the game's top forwards - PSG ace Neymar.He said of the world's most expensive player: \"I won't speak about players who aren't mine. The whole footballing world likes Neymar, he's a great player.\""
