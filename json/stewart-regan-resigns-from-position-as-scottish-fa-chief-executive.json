While it has been tough, I am proud to leave having overseen a period of significant change and substantial growth following the McLeish Report in 2010.\"We are now at another staging point and I recognise that it is now time for further change. I have decided to step aside to allow new leadership to take the organisation forward.\"I would like to thank the staff for their energy, hard work and support during my tenure. Their love of the game mirrors Scotland's passion for football and I am proud to have served the Association.\"The SFA board are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss possible candidates for the Scotland managerial vacancy."
