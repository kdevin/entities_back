  "description": "Sol Campbell has picked his Dream 5-A-Side line up for Soccer AM.",
  "content": "The former Arsenal, Tottenham and England defender has played with a host of great names over the years during his distinguished playing career.But he had a tough choice between two Arsenal legends when picking his striker, eventually opting for Thierry Henry just ahead of Dennis Bergkamp.He said: \"I am going to go for Thierry. Sometimes you just need someone in those tight situations in a big game to be able to turn something out of nothing and get a goal.\"You need great forwards, but sometimes you need a lucky forward as well and I thought Thierry had both. He was very skilful, but also had a knack of being in the right position at the right time.\"It is hard because this is five-a-side. I am struggling because there's so many top, top players I could easily have put in there.\"Dennis Bergkamp came incredibly close. He was strong, quick and he was a genius on the ball. He could be very clever in his movement off the ball.\"He was a magician and an incredibly tough, but skilful guy.\"Who else makes the team?
