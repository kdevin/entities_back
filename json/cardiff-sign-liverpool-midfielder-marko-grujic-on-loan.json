  "description": "Cardiff have beaten a number of championship clubs to the loan signing of Liverpool midfielder Marko Grujic.",
  "content": "The Serbia U21 international, a product of the Red Star Belgrade academy, will go straight into Neil Warnock's squad for Saturday's visit to Sheffield Wednesday.Grujic, 21, has made just eight appearances for Liverpool since becoming Jurgen Klopp's first signing for £5m in January 2016.Warnock had previously been linked with a £3m move for Middlesbrough's Adam Forshaw.However, Grujic's desire to move to South Wales convinced the manager to beat Middlesbrough and Aston Villa to the Serb's signature.The midfielder will be loaned until the end of the season. He has four international caps to date and feels he needs regular first-team football to be included in Serbia's World Cup squad this summer.Cardiff are third in the Sky Bet Championship, just two points short of the automatic promotion places, and face Manchester City in the FA Cup fourth round on January 28."
