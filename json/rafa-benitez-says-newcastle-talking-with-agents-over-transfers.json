We have had some people asking but nothing serious and no offers on any of our players.\n\"But if somebody wants to buy, we'll see if the price is good for us and for the player. But if they talk about loans we are not interested because we need them.\n\"I'm still confident we will do what we have to do but I have to just concentrate on the games.\n\"We are talking with agents but cannot push too much. We will try to do our best until the last day and believe we will do what we have to do.\"\nLooking ahead to this weekend's crucial fixture against Swansea, Benitez says he is not expecting an easy game.\nHe added: \"They have a new manager. They look quite organised, disciplined in defence and difficult to breakdown.\n\"I think it is important we don't lose the game but still have the mentality we have to get three points. It will be a tough game for us.\n\"It'll be hard to create chances against them. A massive game for them, a massive game for us.\"\n",
