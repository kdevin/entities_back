  "description": "Arsene Wenger has confirmed Jack Wilshere suffered an ankle injury in Arsenal's 0-0 draw at Chelsea on Wednesday, which may keep him out of the weekend clash with Bournemouth.",
  "content": "Wilshere went down early in the second-half after blocking a Chelsea cross and was substituted just minutes later.The 26-year-old walked off the pitch unaided, but Wenger confirmed he was brought off with an injury.\"I don't know if he'll be available on Sunday but it's definitely an ankle sprain,\" Wenger said.\"At the moment we have five big injuries and we're hoping to get some back. The earliest to come back is [Aaron] Ramsey and that is quite welcome because it's an area we're a bit short.\"If we didn't lose Jack tonight then we would have had Ramsey back and then maybe [Mesut] Ozil on Sunday, but we could look a bit short.\"Wilshere has recently established himself in the Arsenal team after several long-term injuries, as well as a season-long loan at Bournemouth.Arsenal's options in midfield could be stretched even further with the departure of Francis Coquelin, who Arsene Wenger said would be moving to Valencia.",
