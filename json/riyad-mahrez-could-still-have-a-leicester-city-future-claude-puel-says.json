  "content": "Mahrez did not turn up for training on Thursday or Friday after his proposed move to Manchester City failed to materialise on Deadline Day, and Puel refused to confirm whether the Algerian had been granted permission to miss the sessions.\nHe will not play in their Premier League game with Swansea on Saturday, but Puel tried to strike a conciliatory note at his pre-match media conference.\n\"As a club, we took this decision for the good of Leicester,\" said Puel. \"I think it's the best decision for the club after the position with Riyad.\n\"I will assess Riyad when he clears his head. The business [side] of the transfer window is difficult for us to manage but I think it is time now to move on and keep our focus.\n\"I hope Riyad can clear his head and come back with us because he's a valuable player for us.\n\"We need to stay united after all this.\"\n",
