  "description": "It was a memorable January transfer window featuring record spending as both Manchester City and Liverpool broke their transfer records to bring in new defenders. ",
  "content": "What's more, both City's Aymeric Laporte and Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk could be in action live on Sky Sports Premier League this weekend.But they are not the only new boys in action. Here, we take a look at who to watch out for in the weekend's games…Laporte made an assured debut in Manchester City's dominant 3-0 win over West Brom on Wednesday evening but it could be a trickier assignment for the Premier League leaders when they visit Turf Moor in the early kick-off this Saturday.Burnley have not won a Premier League game in eight attempts but they remain seventh having picked up a number of creditable draws and have added a little more thrust on the flanks this January.Aaron Lennon is set to make his home bow having arrived from Everton and made a promising debut for the Clarets at Newcastle, while Georges-Kevin N'Koudou will be hoping for his first start under Sean Dyche too.It has been a mixed bag for Liverpool of late but perhaps the most surprising aspect of their recent run is that while Van Dijk played in the shock defeats to Swansea and West Brom, he was absent for the impressive victories over Manchester City and Huddersfield.Will Jurgen Klopp be tempted to throw the world's most expensive defender back into the team to face the task of man-marking Harry Kane?Tottenham go into Sunday's game fresh from outplaying Manchester United 2-0 on Wednesday so there may not be too many changes for the trip to Anfield. However, Lucas Moura, the £25m signing from Paris Saint-Germain could feature from the bench.Chelsea introduced new signings Emerson Palmieri and Olivier Giroud to the Stamford Bridge crowd at half-time on Wednesday but the team were promptly beaten 3-0 by Bournemouth in one of the most extraordinary results of the Premier League season.As a result, both men, particularly Giroud, could be pressed into action at Vicarage Road on Monday Night Football - where they will face a Watford team that have been making changes of their own.Didier Ndong and Dodi Lukebakio joined the Hornets late in the January transfer window but it is Gerard Deulofeu, in line for his home debut on loan from Barcelona, who is likely to be the player that Antonio Conte will be most worried about."
