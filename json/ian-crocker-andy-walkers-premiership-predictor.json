  "content": "Just 48 hours on from Christophe Berra's late winner against Hibs in the Scottish Cup we have a midweek card of five Scottish Premiership fixtures.All 12 teams were due to return to league action but the postponement of St Johnstone's Scottish Cup tie with Albion Rovers means their trip to Kilmarnock has had to be rearranged.The fourth round weekend was hit by a flurry of snow, with five of the ties postponed, but the cup didn't fail to provide the usual shock.Highland League Brora Rangers pulled off the surprise of the round with a win away to League One East Fife, and were awarded with a trip to Premiership Kilmarnock in the last 16.Championship side Inverness CT scored late on to force a replay with Dundee after a 2-2 draw at Dens Park and who will forget Scott McMann's horrendous own goal in Motherwell's 2-0 Lanarkshire derby win.And with the return of the Scottish Premiership also comes the thoughts of Ian Crocker and Andy Walker as they give you their predictions and players to watch over the next couple of nights.Partick Thistle v Celtic - Tuesday 7.45pmAndy Walker-Partick Thistle 1-3 CelticKey Player- Leigh GriffithsIt looks likely Moussa Dembele will leave in this transfer window, Griffiths can be the main man again.Ian Crocker-Partick Thistle 1-3 CelticKey Player- James ForrestThirteen goals and counting in a season to remember.Opta Stats-Partick have picked up just one point from a possible 63 available in games against Celtic in the Scottish Premiership (P21 W0 D1 L20), scoring just eight goals in those matches.Celtic have won all 12 of their trips to Partick in the Scottish Premiership by an aggregate score of 33-6.The Jags, who have conceded more goals than any other side in the Scottish Premiership this season (37), have kept two clean sheets in their last three games in the division (W2 L1), as many as they had managed in their opening 19 league fixtures of the season.Celtic have followed up their first league defeat of the season (4-0 away at Hearts) with four consecutive clean sheets in the Scottish Premiership (W3 D1), their best defensive run since November 2016 when they kept a sixth straight shutout.Despite being goalless in his last five league games, Blair Spittal has been directly involved in 37 per cent of Partick's 19 goals in the Scottish Premiership this season (four goals, three assists); only Kilmarnock's Kris Boyd (40 per cent) has had a hand in a larger proportion for his side.Dundee v Hibernian - Wednesday 7.45pmAndy Walker-Dundee 2-1 HibernianKey Player- Mark O'HaraOne of a number of players improving under the guidance of Neil McCann.Ian Crocker-Dundee 1-1 HibernianKey Player- Jamie MacLarenLikely to make his presence on what would be his debut.Opta Stats- Dundee have lost just one of their last nine home games against Hibernian in the Scottish top flight (W5 D3), most recently drawing 1-1 in August.However, Hibs are currently enjoying a four-match unbeaten run against the Dee in the Scottish Premiership (W2 D2). In fact, they have lost just one of the last 13 such clashes (W6 D6).No side has won (seven) or scored (five) more penalties in the Scottish Premiership this season than Dundee.Only Celtic (seven) have kept more clean sheets away from home in the Scottish Premiership than Hibernian (five) this term; four of those have come in their last six such outings (W3 D2 L1).While Dundee are the only Scottish Premiership side yet to gain a point from a losing position this season, opponents Hibs have gained 14 points in games in which they have fallen behind, a league-high.Hamilton Accies v Hearts - Wednesday 7.45pmAndy Walker-Hamilton Accies 1-1 HeartsKey Player- Greg DochertyCould be his last game for Accies with Rangers keen to sign him.Ian Crocker-Hamilton Accies 0-2 HeartsKey Player- Demetri MitchellImpressive Edinburgh derby debut from the on-loan Manchester United youngster.Opta Stats-Hamilton are winless in their last seven league clashes with Hearts (D3 L4), conceding 15 goals in those matches.Since the start of last season, Hearts have scored 13 league goals against the Accies, at least two more than they have bagged against any other side.Hamilton's 3-2 win at home to Ross County ended a run of eight consecutive home league games without a victory (D3 L5); they last won back-to-back home fixtures in the same season in April 2017.Hearts are currently enjoying a nine-game unbeaten run in the Scottish Premiership (W3 D6), their best such streak without defeat in the competition since January 2011 (11 games). Indeed, they haven't conceded a goal in any of their last six such matches, the best run of clean sheets of any side the division this season.Rakish Bingham has scored three goals in his last two home league appearances against Hearts; those three goals account for more than he has scored against any other side in the Scottish Premiership.Motherwell v Ross County - Wednesday 7.45pmAndy Walker-Motherwell 2-0 Ross CountyKey Player- Chris CaddenCould he be the next to leave Fir Park? Cadden has impressed for a couple of seasons now.Ian Crocker-Motherwell 2-1 Ross CountyKey Player- Nadir CiftciAfter a difficult time of late, he might re-invent himself at Fir Park.Opta Stats-Motherwell have lost two of their last three top-flight meetings with Ross County (W1), as many as they had suffered in their previous eight against them (W3 D3 L2).Ross County have beaten Motherwell just twice in 11 Scottish Premiership visits to Fir Park (D3 L6), although those victories have come in the last four such visits (L2).The Steelmen are winless in their last eight Scottish Premiership matches (D2 L6); they haven't gone longer without a win in the competition since May 2003 (10 matches).Only Partick Thistle (four) have scored fewer goals on their travels than Ross County (nine) in the Scottish Premiership this season.Richard Tait has scored a goal in each of his last two home league appearances against Ross County; he has not netted against any other side in the Scottish Premiership.Rangers v Aberdeen - Wednesday 7.45pmAndy Walker-Rangers 2-1 AberdeenKey Player- Russell MartinA much needed dominant figure at the heart of Rangers' defenceIan Crocker-Rangers 2-2 AberdeenKey Player- Jamie MurphyGood to have him back in Scotland and playing for the team of his dreams.Opta Stats-Rangers have lost to Aberdeen just once at Ibrox in the Scottish Premiership (2-1 in May 2017), winning 23 of the 28 such matches and drawing the other four.Since the Gers' return to the Scottish Premiership last season, Aberdeen have conceded 12 goals against them in the competition; only against league leaders Celtic (15) have they let in more in that time.Rangers have won just one of their last four games in the Scottish Premiership having previously won four in a row (including two wins over Aberdeen).Aberdeen have kept back-to-back clean sheets in the top flight, and are looking to keep a third consecutive shutout for the second time this season.Alfredo Morelos has found the net in each of his last three top-flight games at Ibrox (three goals).",
