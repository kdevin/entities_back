Unfortunately we could not win but I lived [in Liverpool] for five years and my family was very happy there. So I just would like to thank them and wish them all the best.\"Coutinho cannot play for Barcelona in the Champions League for the rest of the season because he has already played for Liverpool in the competition this campaign, and will have to wait around three weeks to make his debut after sustaining a thigh injury.\"I won't be able to play some matches now, but it's a five-year contract, so I'll have plenty of time to help the club in the future,\" he said. \"Sometimes you don't get another opportunity like this, to join Barcelona, so I didn't think twice.\"The move to Catalonia will see Coutinho reunite with former Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez and he revealed the Uruguayan helped convince him to leave Anfield for Barcelona.\"We almost won the Premier League together at Liverpool, it was a great time,\" Coutinho said.\"We are good friends and he wrote me a lot of messages telling me about the city and the club.

I'm here to try to gain my space in the team.\""
