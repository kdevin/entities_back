To win the Carabao Cup? Yes, of course, but it would not change the life of Tottenham.\n\"The FA Cup? Fantastic, I would love to win all the competitions in the world but it really changes your life if you win the Premier League or the Champions League. That is the truth.\"\nDanny Rose could make his first start for Tottenham in almost nine months against the Hammers, after a making a late substitute appearance in the 1-1 draw with Real Madrid last week.\nWhen asked at his pre-match press conference if Rose could start on Wednesday, Pochettino said: \"Yes, we need to wait until tomorrow. But in my head maybe there is a possibility for him to start the game tomorrow, yes.\"\n",
