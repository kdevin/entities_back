  "content": "Spurs have made an impressive start to the domestic campaign, having lost just once in the league, while Pochettino's side sit top of their Group H in Europe - above defending champions Real Madrid.However, the Argentine is yet to win a single piece of silverware at Spurs, whose last major honour came back in 2008 following a League Cup final win over London rivals Chelsea.Tottenham host West Ham in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night, live on Sky Sports Football, but Pochettino admits he could rest a number of key players at Wembley.\"Our objective is to win the Premier League, to win the Champions League,\" he said.\"And then there is the FA Cup, of course, I would like to win and I would like to win the Carabao Cup, but if you want to be a big team and fight for big things, I think it is impossible if you don't use all the squad and rotate in England.\"Pochettino added: \"The manager always wants to win. To win the Carabao Cup? Yes, of course, but it would not change the life of Tottenham.\"The FA Cup? Fantastic, I would love to win all the competitions in the world but it really changes your life if you win the Premier League or the Champions League. That is the truth.\"Danny Rose could make his first start for Tottenham in almost nine months against the Hammers, after a making a late substitute appearance in the 1-1 draw with Real Madrid last week.When asked at his pre-match press conference if Rose could start on Wednesday, Pochettino said: \"Yes, we need to wait until tomorrow. But in my head maybe there is a possibility for him to start the game tomorrow, yes.\""
