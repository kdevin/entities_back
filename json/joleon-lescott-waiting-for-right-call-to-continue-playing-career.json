It depends if the phone rings.\"I'm training still, I like to keep fit, I don't find it difficult to do that - it's an enjoyable part of it.\"With my experience, I could be ready to play with a month's training - I would need to do extra to get up to speed, but I don't think the hunger ever goes. The legs go before that, but the desire stays and I enjoy it.\"When asked whether he would be prepared to drop below the Championship to continue his career, he said: \"It would have to be the right opportunity and fit the right aspects of my life.\"I made the decision later in my career to keep the family where they are, so Manchester way.
