  "content": "The former Everton and Manchester City defender is without a club after leaving Sunderland at the end of last season and trained with non-league side AFC Telford at the end of 2017.The 35-year-old told Goals on Sunday he would consider any offer if it was right for him and his family, suggesting he could play up front for a Sunday league side.When asked if he will play again, the former England man said: \"I don't know! It depends if the phone rings.\"I'm training still, I like to keep fit, I don't find it difficult to do that - it's an enjoyable part of it.\"With my experience, I could be ready to play with a month's training - I would need to do extra to get up to speed, but I don't think the hunger ever goes. The legs go before that, but the desire stays and I enjoy it.\"When asked whether he would be prepared to drop below the Championship to continue his career, he said: \"It would have to be the right opportunity and fit the right aspects of my life.\"I made the decision later in my career to keep the family where they are, so Manchester way. I could play up front in the Sunday league I reckon.\""
