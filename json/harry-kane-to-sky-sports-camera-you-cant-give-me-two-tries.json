  "description": "Harry Kane had a cheeky message for the Sky Sports cameras after scoring a late penalty to give Tottenham a point at Liverpool.",
  "content": "As he left the pitch at the end of an epic 2-2 draw at Anfield, the Tottenham striker was celebrating his injury-time equaliser from the penalty spot, which came only a few minutes after he had seen his first penalty saved by Loris Karius.\nAnd he turned to our cameraman and said: \"You can't give me two tries.\"\nLiverpool were leading 1-0 with 12 minutes left after Mohamed Salah's opener but Victor Wanyama thumped Spurs level before Kane won a penalty.\nAlthough Kane saw his effort saved, he did not make the same mistake in injury-time, firing home his 100th Premier League goal to secure a draw.\nAsked by Sky Sports Jamie Redknapp whether he has his sights on Alan Shearer's Premier League record of 260, Kane said: \"Let's hope so, but it's so far away, he scored so many goals. It's great to be in the 100 club and it was nice to get something out of the game after the rollercoaster of emotions.\n\"Going 1-0 down at Anfield it almost feels you are under the cosh no matter how you are playing. When the gaffer spoke to us at half-time he said we are playing alright, we are keeping possession, but we need to create more chances, just keep doing in in the second half and the spaces will come.\n\"We fully deserved to get to 1-1 and probably deserved to win it but in the end we will take the draw.\"\nWatch Kane's message to the Sky Sports cameras in the video at the top of this page.\n",
