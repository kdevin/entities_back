What we need to look at is what was happening immediately prior.\"\nHe said Puncheon denied the assault or using behaviour likely to cause fear of violence.\nChairwoman of the magistrates Ann Terry sent the case for trial to be heard at Staines Magistrates' Court on June 4 and released him on bail, with the conditions not to contact Mr Mendy or enter the Mishiko nightclub.\nShe told Puncheon, who was sitting in a chair with his injured leg on another chair during the proceedings: \"I am not asking you to stand.\n\"The trial will be on June 4. You will need to be within the court precincts by 9.15am to speak with your representative. Until that time, you will remain on conditional bail.\"\n",
