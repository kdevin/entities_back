  "title": "Man City will be Alexis Sanchez's next club, says Craig Bellamy",
  "description": "Craig Bellamy can only see Alexis Sanchez moving to Manchester City, whether in January or in the summer.",
  "content": "The Arsenal forward has six months left to run on his deal at the Emirates, and Sky in Italy are reporting that City already have a financial package in place for the Chilean should he choose to leave in the summer.Speaking on The Debate, Bellamy is sure Sanchez will add to Manchester City's impressive forward line.\"I'm a huge fan of him,\" said Bellamy. \"Even with the quality Manchester City have going forward, would he add to that? Yes he would. I can only see him being at Manchester City. And if it isn't in this transfer window it will be for free in the summer.\"Arsenal don't have to sell - they can say: 'We've got this far, we'll see it out'. But at the same time, would I take that risk? I'm not sure.\"If Sanchez leaves Arsenal now, the Gunners will receive a fee for the forward, but if Sanchez was to move to City in the summer, Sky in Italy claim he would earn £13m-a-year in wages, plus a £30m signing-on fee.Bellamy and Liam Rosenior, who was also speaking on The Debate, are unsure whether Sanchez will be motivated by the monetary reward for moving in the summer, with City fighting on four fronts for silverware this season.Rosenior said: \"It depends what his motivations are. Some players are motivated by money, some players are motivated by trophies.\"If his motivation is trophies, then he's in a fantastic position to go now, but if it's money, what's five months if you can get £30m in your bank account at the end of it.\"Bellamy added: \"Money won't be a problem to this guy. He hasn't got a World Cup this summer, and that has hurt him, that played a big part in his form at the start of the season, playing too many games. He hasn't missed a summer for four years.\"After they failed to qualify for the World Cup he got stick back at home, which was new to him because he's a hero in Chile. But at the same time, if you have a club like Manchester City, with four trophies to go for, I'm sure that will be the main motive for him.\"",
