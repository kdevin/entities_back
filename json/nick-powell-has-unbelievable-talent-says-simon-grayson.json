  "description": "Simon Grayson has hailed the \"unbelievable talent\" of Wigan forward Nick Powell, following his resurgence with the club in League One.",
  "content": "The former Manchester United man has come into his own this season as the club top the third tier, and had interest from Premier League clubs during the transfer window.Speaking on EFL Matters on Thursday, Grayson said: \"I went to watch him against West Ham in the FA Cup last Saturday and he was the best player on the pitch.\"He's has got unbelievable talent this lad. There are some factors that have maybe contributed to him not having a successful time so far, but maybe he's found a home. Maybe he's thought: 'I'm enjoying it at Wigan and I'm a big player in this group, learning to be the best and taking on the responsibility.'\"Without a shadow of a doubt he's got unbelievable technique.\"Wigan have bounced back swiftly from their relegation last season and look set to return to the Championship at the first time of asking.And Danny Higginbotham, who joined Grayson and presenter David Prutton on the show, believes boss Paul Cook deserves praise for leading the Latics to the top of the table.\"You've got to give great credit to Paul Cook for the way he's gone about things,\" said Higginbotham. \"He had promotions and Portsmouth and Chesterfield and you won't find it much more difficult than what he went through at Portsmouth.\"They've also kept hold of Powell, which sets a bit of a statement, and brought in Devante Cole, who had scored 10 [league] goals at Fleetwood. There'll be some real optimism at the club.\""
