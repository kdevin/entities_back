I still have a lot of friends there and it was a really good time for me.\"Karanka is now firmly focused on Saturday's high-profile Championship clash at home to Aston Villa - live on Sky Sports Football from 5.15pm - and will wait until after the match before discussing possible transfers with the board.\"Saturday is a really important game and after that, we will have time to think about everything,\" he said.\"Another big club, in front of the cameras.
