  "description": "Paul Cook admitted everything fell Wigan's way as they defeated Bournemouth in an FA Cup third-round replay.",
  "content": "The League One leaders recorded a 3-0 success over the Cherries at the DW Stadium after Sam Morsy's early strike was added to by a pair of goals in quick succession from substitute Dan Burn and defender Callum Elder.It was Bournemouth who Wigan defeated at this stage en route to winning the competition when a top-flight side five years ago.When told it was Bournemouth who Wigan beat at the start of their cup run in 2013, Cook replied: \"I love that one, me! I think it has been mentioned but I think there's a gulf in class between teams now.\"If West Ham were to turn up with all their first-team players, we're not stupid, we know the type of game we would be in for. We're delighted to win.\"It's a fantastic game, West Ham are a big club with massive support. I'm sure they'll travel here in large numbers. For us, it's a good diversion from the league but nothing can detract from our main objective which is trying to be promoted this season.\"Games go for you sometimes. Everything's gone our way. We can enjoy the night, it's a good win for us but the scoreline, in my opinion, was very flattering to us.\"Bournemouth had fought back from two goals down in the first encounter between the two to force a replay but they lacked that kind of fighting spirit on a miserable night in the north west.Cherries boss Eddie Howe claimed he had no regrets about making eight changes to his team having conceded he was wrong to switch all 11 players for their third-round exit to Millwall last year.However, Howe also acknowledged that those who were brought in at the DW Stadium had done little to force their way into his thinking for Saturday's trip to West Ham.\"The players I picked are the main regular Premier League players who've done so well for the club over a long, long period of time,\" Howe argued. \"I didn't take any major risks with the team selection and Wigan made changes as well. We can't use that as an excuse.\"I think the changes last year definitely affected the result, I would be the first to admit that. This year, no. I don't think I can look at that team and regret any of those players who played. The majority have done so well for me over a long time. The reality is they didn't perform.\"Every time you put on the shirt it's an opportunity for you to impress and make sure you make my decisions for the next game harder, I don't think many did that.\""
