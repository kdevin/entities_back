  "content": "The day began with Arsenal wrapping up their much-anticipated club-record transfer to land Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund, while Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi completed switches to Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund respectively to complete the protracted three-way transfer saga, and there were plenty more big money deals closed as the day wore on.Lucas Moura's move to Tottenham from Paris Saint-Germain was finally confirmed late in the day, but there was less joy for Manchester City and Riyad Mahrez, after Leicester refused to sanction a switch for the Algerian which Sky Sports News has been told has left the 2015/16 footballer of the year \"depressed\".There was a wasted trip to Belgium for Newcastle's Alexander Mitrovic, a failed eleventh-hour bid from Arsenal for West Brom's Jonny Evans, an army of freezing Sky Sports reporters peppered across Premier League grounds around the country, and the odd furry friend getting into the transfer deadline day spirit.Hit the video at the top of the page to re-live all the best moments from Deadline Day on Sky Sports News."
