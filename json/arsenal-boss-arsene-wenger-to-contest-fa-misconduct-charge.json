  "description": "Arsene Wenger intends to contest a charge of misconduct from the Football Association - as he added further criticism of officials following Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Chelsea.",
  "content": "Wenger was on Tuesday charged following his conduct in the referee's changing room after Sunday's game against West Brom.Wenger was furious with referee Mike Dean, who had awarded West Brom a late penalty at The Hawthorns for a handball by Calum Chambers.Wenger has until 6pm on Friday to respond, but refutes the charge.Asked if he planned to contest the charge, Wenger said: \"100 per cent. You can listen to every interview I said. I stick to everything I said without a problem.\"Wenger was speaking after a pulsating and at times controversial 2-2 draw with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium.He was infuriated by what he called a \"farcical\" penalty, which was converted by Eden Hazard after the Belgium playmaker was fouled by Hector Bellerin.\"At the moment we have to face surprising decisions,\" Wenger added.Asked again about the incident at West Brom, Wenger said: \"I know what I said and I stand by what I said.\"It had looked like Chelsea had come from behind to triumph when Marcos Alonso struck six minutes from time, after Jack Wilshere's first league goal since May 2015 had been cancelled out by Hazard's spot-kick.But the Gunners would not be beaten and Bellerin punished Alonso's poor clearing header with a fine finish for a share of the points - though there was still time for Chelsea's Davide Zappacosta to hit the crossbar.Wenger brought up the subject of the penalty in his post-match media conference, before bemoaning the media's interest in matters which have \"nothing to do with football\".\"We got again a farcical decision on the penalty, but we knew that as well before [the game],\" he said.\"What I find terrible is that we have just seen a great football game and we talk only about things nothing to do with football.\"For me it would be nice to at some stage talk about football again.\"",
