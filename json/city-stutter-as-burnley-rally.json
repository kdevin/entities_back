  "description": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson's late strike cancelled out Danilo's first-half stunner as Premier League leaders Manchester City were held to a 1-1 draw at Burnley.",
  "content": "While pre-match talk at Turf Moor was dominated by Pep Guardiola's decision to name only six substitutes, it appeared to be business as usual for City when Danilo curled in a sublime effort after 22 minutes.\nHowever, just minutes after Raheem Sterling missed an open goal for City, Gudmundsson met Matthew Lowton's cross (82) to ensure the spoils were shared.\nThe draw sees City's gap close to 13 points after goals from Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez inspired Manchester United to a 2-0 win against Huddersfield at Old Trafford.\nCity typically controlled possession from the off, but failed to carve out a telling chance until Danilo's bolt from the blue.\nFrom a short corner, Bernardo Silva rolled the ball across to the left-back, who took a touch before curling an effort beyond Nick Pope from 25 yards out.\nBen Mee had two chances to level for the hosts, but saw Ederson palm away his volley before sending a header narrowly wide.\nPope's chest denied Sergio Aguero just before half-time, and moments after the break it was the back of Lowton which denied the Argentine a certain goal.\nAfter Pope denied Danilo from a similar position to the first goal, Ederson was on hand down the other end to tip Aaron Lennon's rising shot onto the bar.\nA miss-of-the-season contender from Sterling followed, with the winger shooting wide from inside the six-yard box following Kyle Walker's ball in.\nSterling and City were made to pay for that miss, as Gudmundsson latched onto Lowton's cross from deep to secure a point for Burnley.\nEderson impressed in goal for City with his composure and two top-quality saves, but he was powerless to prevent Gudmundsson's leveller, despite getting a hand to the effort.\nGudmundsson has been involved in seven goals for Burnley this season - three more than any other player - and his most memorable contribution of the campaign could well be this equaliser against the champions-elect.\nThe Icelandic winger backed up his goal with three key passes for the hosts, the highest passing accuracy of all Burnley players (77 per cent) and more interceptions (five) than any other player on the pitch.\nSean Dyche: \"We showed a fantastic mentality. We are on a tough run at the minute and people will say no wins in nine now with that result, but I think it's fair to say that's a big and important result. As you can see there is not a lack of belief. We've still got to have quality, we've still got to have an understanding of the Premier League but the collective mentality and the spirit here is unbelievable. It's a powerful thing. We all know you've got to have enough tactical savvy and technical ability but that team connection is the final cog in what we do here. It was on show here today.\"\nPep Guardiola on Sterling's miss: \"It is football. Next day he is going to score a goal. Raheem scored against Southampton in the 96th minute. Today he missed one chance. That can happen.\"\nDespite the result, City were still really good. Sometimes you are that good and that dominant in a game you can become a bit bored with being that dominant. The problem was not taking that final chance which kills the game off but it's not a massive problem for City. They still played very well.\nBurnley kept going and stayed in the game, but City were still the dominant team and they should have won the game. They'll be disappointed but they shouldn't be too down on themselves.\nManchester City host Leicester City in next Saturday's evening kick-off, live on Sky Sports Premier League, which could see Riyad Mahrez face the club he had hoped to join in January. Burnley, meanwhile, travel to Swansea next Saturday in a 3pm kick-off.\n",
