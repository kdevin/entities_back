He's a player we know very well, he's really capable of playing at this level and capable of taking us to the next level, and the frontline becomes more and more exciting.\"It's all about trying to find players who are going to improve who we are and what we do, and in Benik Afobe we've found just that.\"He has a massive affinity with the fans. He's got a massive affinity with the football club, and would probably argue it's his first love, even though he spent a lot of time at Arsenal.\"I think he recognises what's going on at the club and wants to be a part of it, and we've got him in to be part of the final promotion push.\""
