  "content": "Voting closes at 6pm on Tuesday, January 16...David Brooks - Millwall v SHEFF UTDA visual delight as the 20-year-old combined with Mark Duffy to glorious effect. Duffy floated the ball into the path of Brooks, who controlled his tight-angled volley exquisitely.Jamie Paterson - Sheff Utd v BRISTOL CITYWhat a way to relieve the pressure on his side. Bursting into the attack, Paterson collected a square ball, slipped his way past a defender and arrowed home a searing low strike.Adam Reach - Nottingham Forest v SHEFF WEDNot content with his November award, Reach was at it again on Boxing Day, connecting so powerfully with a bouncing clearance that the ball was still rising as it struck the net.Shaun Whalley - MK Dons v SHREWSBURYShown outside by a defender, Whalley seized the moment to drive past his man and, without a moment's hesitation, connect with a 30-yard strike into the opposite top corner.Mark Byrne - GILLINGHAM v Bristol RoversTraining ground corner routines cannot be executed any better than this. Byrne sprinted into the area, judged the flight of the ball and perfectly timed a stunning volley on the run.Graham Carey - Blackpool v PLYMOUTHCarey combined determination and technique as he chased a flick-on. Running towards the corner flag, he swivelled and struck the sweetest of volleys into the far top corner.Jamal Campbell-Ryce - BARNET v Morecambe There seemed no danger when Campbell-Ryce got the ball near the touchline on halfway. That was until he jinked inside, strode forward and curled home a sumptuous 30-yarder.Callum Ainley - CREWE v CrawleyCollecting a raking pass near the by-line, the 20-year-old danced inside a defender and left Crawley 'keeper Glenn Morris motionless with an arrowhead shot into the far top corner.Otis Khan - Morecambe v YEOVIL Shielding the ball as drove towards the area, Khan exchanged passes with team-mate Jake Gray, took one touch and then looped his unstoppable shot into the far corner.",
