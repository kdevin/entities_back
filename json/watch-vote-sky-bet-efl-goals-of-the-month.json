  "content": "Voting closes at 6pm on Tuesday, January 16...\nDavid Brooks - Millwall v SHEFF UTD\nA visual delight as the 20-year-old combined with Mark Duffy to glorious effect. Duffy floated the ball into the path of Brooks, who controlled his tight-angled volley exquisitely.\nJamie Paterson - Sheff Utd v BRISTOL CITY\nWhat a way to relieve the pressure on his side. Bursting into the attack, Paterson collected a square ball, slipped his way past a defender and arrowed home a searing low strike.\nAdam Reach - Nottingham Forest v SHEFF WED\nNot content with his November award, Reach was at it again on Boxing Day, connecting so powerfully with a bouncing clearance that the ball was still rising as it struck the net.\nShaun Whalley - MK Dons v SHREWSBURY\nShown outside by a defender, Whalley seized the moment to drive past his man and, without a moment's hesitation, connect with a 30-yard strike into the opposite top corner.\nMark Byrne - GILLINGHAM v Bristol Rovers\nTraining ground corner routines cannot be executed any better than this. Byrne sprinted into the area, judged the flight of the ball and perfectly timed a stunning volley on the run.\nGraham Carey - Blackpool v PLYMOUTH\nCarey combined determination and technique as he chased a flick-on. Running towards the corner flag, he swivelled and struck the sweetest of volleys into the far top corner.\nJamal Campbell-Ryce - BARNET v Morecambe\nThere seemed no danger when Campbell-Ryce got the ball near the touchline on halfway. That was until he jinked inside, strode forward and curled home a sumptuous 30-yarder.\nCallum Ainley - CREWE v Crawley\nCollecting a raking pass near the by-line, the 20-year-old danced inside a defender and left Crawley 'keeper Glenn Morris motionless with an arrowhead shot into the far top corner.\nOtis Khan - Morecambe v YEOVIL\nShielding the ball as drove towards the area, Khan exchanged passes with team-mate Jake Gray, took one touch and then looped his unstoppable shot into the far corner.\n",
