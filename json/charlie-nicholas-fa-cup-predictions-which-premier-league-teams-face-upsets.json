  "description": "Charlie Nicholas says West Ham and Arsenal must be careful of an FA Cup upset on Sunday, as he looks ahead to the three games involving Premier League clubs. ",
  "content": "Stoke, Burnley and Everton are the three top-flight clubs to be knocked out of the competition already this weekend, with Arsenal, West Ham and Tottenham all in action on Sunday.West Ham travel to Shrewsbury, while Arsenal are at Nottingham Forest and Spurs host AFC Wimbledon.And here is what Charlie is predicting for the London trio...Shrewsbury v West Ham (Sunday 2pm)This is difficult for West Ham because this is the last thing they need after their back-to-back games and the lack of numbers David Moyes is down to.It could be a troubling day for them and you worry whether they'll able to match their hosts' energy after tough games on Tuesday and Thursday.Charlie predicts: 1-2 (15/2 with Sky Bet)Nottingham Forest v Arsenal (Sunday 4pm)I am concerned about Arsenal here. Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere and Alexandre Lacazette won't play but the real concern is that defence. Per Mertesacker will come back in because Calum Chambers is absolutely broken.I'd still expect Arsenal to progress with Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott good enough and experienced enough to get them through what looks a very awkward clash.Charlie predicts: 2-3 (22/1 with Sky Bet)Tottenham v AFC Wimbledon (Sunday 3pm)One of Tottenham's biggest problems this season is opposition sides raising their levels for the trip to Wembley but, while it will be a great away day for the fans, it is one hell of a bridge to gap for a side sitting just outside the Sky Bet League One relegation places.Mauricio Pochettino will make changes but has options to do so with several players coming back from injuries and they've certainly had their critics for the way they crashed out of the Carabao Cup, so I can't see anything other than an emphatic home win here.Charlie predicts: 5-0 (12/1 with Sky Bet)"
