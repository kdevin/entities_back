  "description": "Martin O'Neill is the Sky Bet favourite to succeed the departed Mark Hughes as Stoke City boss after the Welshman was relieved of his duties in the wake of the club's 2-1 loss to League Two Coventry City in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.Â ",
  "content": "The Republic of Ireland manager is the 6/4 favourite to step into Hughes's shoes as the Potters step up their search for a replacement for the man who led them for four-and-a-half years, with Derby County boss Gary Rowett running a close second and Ryan Giggs, Slaven Bilic and Ronald Koeman also in contention.We take a closer look at how the odds have altered since the axe fell on Hughes on Saturday.O'Neill was installed as 5/1 favourite to success Hughes on Saturday, but the odds on the former Sunderland, Aston Villa and Leicester boss returning to Premier League management for the first time since being sacked by the Black Cats in March 2013 have now been cut to 6/4.The former Birmingham City boss has enjoyed revived fortunes since being appointed by Derby County in March of last year, guiding the club to second in the Sky Bet Championship just past the midway stage, and his odds to succeed Hughes have shortened from 16/1 on Saturday to 7/4.Giggs has been linked with a host of vacant managerial roles since leaving Manchester United in 2016, and his odds of taking up the reigns of a Premier League side for the first time since a caretaker stint at Old Trafford in the wake of David Moyes' departure in 2014 have dropped from 14/1 to 13/2.The Croatian experienced a difficult final 18 months in charge at West Ham despite impressing in his debut season and turned down the opportunity to talk to West Brom about their managerial vacancy after Tony Pulis was sacked in November. Bilic is fourth favourite to step in at the Bet365 Stadium at 12/1.The former Everton boss has been out of work since being dismissed from the Goodison Park hotseat following the Toffees' dreadful start to the season, and the Dutchman's odds have lengthened from 10/1 on Saturday to 14/1.All odds correct as of 3pm on Sunday January 7.
