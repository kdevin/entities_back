  "description": "Eibar turned in a commanding performance against a lacklustre Sevilla to record a thumping 5-1 victory in La Liga on Saturday.",
  "content": "Kike set the tone for the hosts when he opened the scoring after only 38 seconds before Fabian Orellana added a second with 17 minutes gone.\nPablo Sarabia pulled one back for Sevilla from the penalty spot midway through the opening half, but Ivan Ramis restored Eibar's two-goal advantage when he netted with 32 minutes gone.\nOrellana scored his second shortly after the hour mark before Anaitz Arbilla completed the demolition job with seven minutes remaining. Eibar are just a point behind Sevilla, who currently occupy sixth place.\nReal Betis forward Loren Moron scored twice on his debut in a 2-1 victory against Villarreal.\nThe visitors played the best part of an hour with only 10 men after Daniele Bonera was sent off following a rash tackle on Ruben Castro with 31 minutes gone.\nMoren then netted in first-half stoppage time before doubling his tally shortly after the hour.\nCarlos Bacca scored from the penalty spot with 10 minutes left to give Villarreal hope, but Betis saw out the victory to move up to ninth.\nElsewhere, Alaves inched further away from the relegation zone after withstanding a dominant Celta Vigo to win 2-1 at the Estadio Mendizorroza.\nThe Basque outfit scored twice inside the opening 18 minutes as Alfonso Pedraza's opener was added to by Munir El Haddadi from Ibai Gomez's cross.\nCelta controlled matters thereafter and reduced the deficit in the final minute through Iago Aspas' superb solo run and finish - but it was not enough.\n",
