  "description": "Chris Hughton has supported the FA's \"promising and worthwhile\"  decision to introduce the 'Rooney Rule' when appointing Gareth Southgate's successor.",
  "content": "The FA announced they would introduce the policy as part of new reform plans for 2018 on Tuesday, alongside a series of initiatives aimed to improve the culture of the governing body in 2018.The 'Rooney Rule' is an NFL policy that requires the league's 32 teams to interview black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) candidates for head coaching and senior operation roles.Hughton, who is the only BAME manager in the Premier League, commended the changes introduced by the FA, saying we must continue to progress rather than focus on past mistakes.\"For the FA to make the decision that they have made I think it's something that is very promising and worthwhile,\" said Hughton.When asked whether they should have made the move earlier, he replied: \"Well I think we can talk about a lot of aspects and rights and wrongs on what could have been done.\"But, what we have to do now is speak about the progress that can be made. Certainly I would applaud what they've done and certainly I would see it as a positive.\"When asked if Premier League clubs should follow suit, Hughton said: \"They are the next stages, and all we want on this subject is for progress to be made.\"Eventually all we want is to see more black and ethnic coaches involved at the higher levels of the game and anything that can help that, promote that is something very much worthwhile.\""
