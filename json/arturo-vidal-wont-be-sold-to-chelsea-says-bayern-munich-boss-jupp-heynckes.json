Arturo Vidal is very motivated, he's a top player and we need him at his very best if Bayern is to play well.\"\nHe added: \"We won't sell any players in the [transfer] window.\"\nBayern are currently 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and next face Bayer Leverkusen on January 12 when the German season resumes after its winter break.\n",
