  "description": "West Bromwich Albion have reached an agreement with Egyptian side Zamalek to take defender Ali Gabr to The Hawthorns, Sky Sports News understands. ",
  "content": "The deal is for an initial loan until the end of the season, but includes an option for Albion to buy him for Â£1.5m.The move comes as Alan Pardew becomes increasingly frustrated with the situation with Jonny Evans. We understand Arsenal and Manchester City are interested in the defender, but neither have made any contact since the first week of the January window.Pardew wants to strengthen his squad, but cannot spend money on a transfer fee without first selling at least one player because of Financial Fair Play regulations.We have been told he sees Gabr as the perfect solution - a centre back who they can use now as cover and who they can buy if the speculation about Evans drags on into the summer window.Pardew is keen to increase his attacking options as well and has lined up a number of possibilities should he have funds available from an Evans sale.Troy Deeney is one of those possibilities, but Sky Sports News has been told Watford will not let him go to a rival.However, Borussia Dortmund forward Andre Schurrle is not currently being considered by Albion.",
