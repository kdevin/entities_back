  "description": "Under-fire Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino has been given a vote of confidence by the club's chairman Ralph Krueger.",
  "content": "Following a dreadful run of form, which has yielded not a single Premier League victory in nine games, Saints are 17th in the table.\nOnly goal difference separates them from the relegation zone but Krueger insists the manager has the full backing of the board.\nSpeaking to The Daily Echo, Krueger explained: \"It's interesting how in difficult times everybody wants to blame an individual and have somebody's head taken as a result.\n\"That's easy. It's very easy to pick on somebody. It's an easy target and it's not what we are.\n\"We are all, including myself, responsible in some shape or percentage point for where we are today.\n\"It is not down to one individual that we are now in a challenging position. That is absolutely not the case.\n\"I was a head coach for 25 years and the tough thing is you are the one in front of the cameras every day.\n\"At Southampton, we are all in this together. We are all speaking honestly and openly. We are not happy. We are working on solutions, we are fighting.\n\"In our club we communicate regularly and we discuss very openly and honestly the evolution and I know Mauricio knows he has the full backing.\"\n",
