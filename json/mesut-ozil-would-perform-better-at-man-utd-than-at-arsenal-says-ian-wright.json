  "description": "Ian Wright thinks Mesut Ozil would perform better at Manchester United than he has at Arsenal.",
  "content": "Ozil is out of contract at the end of the season and can talk to foreign clubs this month with a view to walking away from Arsenal for free in the summer.Wenger has insisted the club will not cash in on the playmaker in the January transfer window and has routinely said he remains hopeful Ozil can be tied down to a new deal.Asked if Ozil would perform better if he moved to United, a club he has been linked with in the British press, Arsenal legend Wright said on The Debate: \"Yes. I do. I don't think he's that type of player who will drag a team by its bootlaces through a game, but if your team is playing well, he will sprinkle stardust.\"With the players he'd be playing with at United as well, he is unbelievable. He is just awesome, and with the right team, and the right movement in front of him, he is easily one of the best I've seen. He's amazing.\"Is this difficult to say? Yeah. And we can't keep arguably two of the best players, arguably in the history of the club, ability-wise. It's sad times.\"It remains to be seen who Arsenal will target to replace Ozil and Alexis Sanchez should they leave the club, but Leicester's Riyad Mahrez has been linked with the Emirates.Asked if the Algerian is a suitable replacement, Wright said: \"Arsenal are in a position now where someone like Mahrez has to go there and really pull up trees to get them back to a position where they should be.\"What help would Mahrez have? They're looking at two unbelievable players who might walk out of the club.\"",
