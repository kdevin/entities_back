  "description": "The chairman of Kick It Out, Lord Herman Ouseley, says recent allegations of bullying and racism in football are just the \"tip of the iceberg\".",
  "content": "Newcastle U23s coach Peter Beardsley has taken a period of leave from the club while claims of bullying and racism made against him are investigated, while two former Chelsea coaches have denied allegations of racism and bullying made against them by three ex-Chelsea youth players.Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Lord Ouseley said: \"The fact is that a lot of people who make complaints still feel let down.\"It is a tip of the iceberg. It just tells you what a lot of people have gone through over the years which we know they have gone through - across the entirety of football.\"It is very difficult to comment on individual cases once a process is in place.\"But, in general, there is a problem with the way that inquiries are conducted, and support given to complainants.\"Ouseley, the former chief executive of the Commission for Racial Equality, said his organisation still receives reports of cases in which players were too scared to speak out.He added: \"There is a fear factor with professional football which has existed in the dressing room and on the training ground.\"Certainly anyone with aspirations as a black person to play professional football has kept their heads down and tried to avoid taking on the established status quo of challenging the coach, the trainer or the football manager.\"They have not gone outside of that arena to try and get redress because where they have and where they know of anyone challenging, they have had their heads chopped off. That has been the death of their careers.\""
