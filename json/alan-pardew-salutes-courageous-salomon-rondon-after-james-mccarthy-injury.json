  "content": "The Venezuela international was involved in a second-half collision which resulted in the Everton midfielder suffering a double leg fracture.Rondon was visibly cut up by the incident and had to be consoled in the aftermath by his manager, but he recovered to produce a valiant performance, and so nearly won the game with a stoppage-time effort which struck the bar.\"Salomon was traumatised because he probably heard a break or something, a noise that would have affected him, he's that kind of person,\" Pardew told Sky Sports.\"I wasn't sure if he was going to carry on but he got himself together after being affected and, fair play to him, he was the best player on the pitch today.\"He was awesome for us and it was such a shame he hit the bar at the end.\"Jay Rodriguez fired West Brom ahead inside seven minutes at Goodison Park and the Baggies were within 20 minutes of claiming back-to-back Premier League wins under Pardew until substitute Oumar Niasse equalised with his first touch.\"It's not often you come to Goodison Park and feel slightly disappointed,\" Pardew added. \"We felt we could have won that game.\"We played well at times, took the lead, frustrated Everton and had them where we wanted them.\"They only had about two or three chances in the game and they scored from one and that got them back in the game.\"The unsavoury incident in the game, which led to James McCarthy getting a bad injury affected everybody a little bit.\"I'm disappointed for the lad whose been injured but we're also disappointed we didn't get a result.\""
