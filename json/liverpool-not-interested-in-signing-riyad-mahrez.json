  "content": "Reports had previously suggested that the Algerian winger was close to joining Liverpool in a deal worth around £50m after the Reds agreed to sell Coutinho to Barcelona on Saturday. However, Sky sources understand there has been no contact between Liverpool and Mahrez's club Leicester City.Although Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is in the market for a creative forward, similar to Coutinho, he is not now expected to swoop for Mahrez who was a key figure when the Foxes shocked the football world in 2016 by winning the Premier League.It is also believed that Leicester would want much more than £50m for their player.The Anfield club have already spent £75m in signing defender Virgil van Dijk from Southampton."
