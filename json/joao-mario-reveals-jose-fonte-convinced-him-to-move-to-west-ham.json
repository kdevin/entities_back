That's made it easier.\"He said good things and tried to convince me all of the time. He told me to come to the best league, a great club and enjoy. That helped a lot so I came to see for myself.\"Mario and Fonte were team-mates in Portugal's Euro 2016 winning squad and the pair will no doubt be keen to replicate that success as West Ham battle against relegation.Beyond the Premier League campaign, Mario has his sights set on representing his country at this summer's World Cup.And the Portuguese believes guiding the Hammers to safety can secure his spot on the plane to Russia.\"It's a World Cup year so I need to be fit and playing to be in the squad, that's the main reason I left Inter,\" Mario added. \"I also want to help West Ham and help myself with this experience in the Premier League.\"It's so competitive here, I was used to a different league, different football.
