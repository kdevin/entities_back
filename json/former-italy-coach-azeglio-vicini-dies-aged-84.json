He believed in me and if I am what I am, 80 per-cent of the merit belongs to coach Vicini.\"I hope the football world remembers him like he deserves to be remembered. He was a coach from another era, a real professional, and the advice he gave me was fatherly.\"The federation said a moment of silence will be observed to mourn Vicini before Wednesday's Italian Cup semi-final between AC Milan and Lazio, and also before all Serie A matches this weekend.As a footballer, Vicini played for Vicenza, Sampdoria and Brescia who he also managed, along with Cesena and Udinese.He also coached Italy's under-23 and under-21 teams, and is survived by his wife and three children."
