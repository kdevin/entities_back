  "description": "Azeglio Vicini, the coach of Italy when they hosted the World Cup finals in 1990, has died at the age of 84.",
  "content": "Vicini, who led Italy for five years from 1986, also guided the Azzurri to the semi-finals of the 1988 European Championship in Germany.\nDuring the 1990 Finals, Italy's only defeat came at the hands of Argentina, who progressed to the final following a penalty shootout.\nItaly went on to finish third in the tournament after beating England, who had also lost on penalties at the semi-final stage against eventual winners West Germany.\nItaly's football federation reported on Wednesday that Vicini had died in his hometown of Brescia.\nSalvatore Schillaci, the leading scorer at the finals 28 years ago, said of Vicini: \"He was a man who was hugely important for my footballing life.\n\"He made me known all around the world. He believed in me and if I am what I am, 80 per-cent of the merit belongs to coach Vicini.\n\"I hope the football world remembers him like he deserves to be remembered. He was a coach from another era, a real professional, and the advice he gave me was fatherly.\"\nThe federation said a moment of silence will be observed to mourn Vicini before Wednesday's Italian Cup semi-final between AC Milan and Lazio, and also before all Serie A matches this weekend.\nAs a footballer, Vicini played for Vicenza, Sampdoria and Brescia who he also managed, along with Cesena and Udinese.\nHe also coached Italy's under-23 and under-21 teams, and is survived by his wife and three children.\n",
