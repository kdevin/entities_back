  "description": "Slaven Bilic has warned that clubs like West Ham will enjoy short-term gains by changing their manager, but it will be difficult to keep fans happy in the long term.",
  "content": "Bilic was axed by West Ham earlier this season and replaced by David Moyes, who has picked up 17 points from 13 matches so far and seen the team climb to 11th in the Premier League tableWatford became the eighth top-flight team to change manager this season when they replaced Marco Silva with Javi Gracia on Sunday - and all of the previous seven have seen their points-per-game improve under their new boss.Bilic feels the new managers have succeeded by adopting a \"back-to-basics\" approach - but does not feel that is sustainable.\"It's one of the biggest reasons why clubs are changing the managers,\" he told Monday Night Football.\"It's one of the old cliches, you can't change the mentality, you can't change 22 players so you change the manager and he takes responsibility. Unfortunately, it's a part of the job.\"I totally agree you are only as good as your last few games and what is common to all of them [the new managers] is going back to basics.\"When you are struggling, you want a clean sheet and you don't want to lose games.\"He added: \"It's always easier for a new face to go back to basics, which is about being on your toes, being aggressive and all that.\"Don't get me wrong. All of them are doing a great job. I am most interested in West Ham and David Moyes is doing a great job so far and I wish him all the best.\"But all of them have done back-to-basics type things which is understandable because you need points. That's one of the reasons why clubs are changing.\"But every fan wants his team to play like Man City or Barcelona. Back to basics long term doesn't satisfy the fans or the board because people want spectacle.\"",
