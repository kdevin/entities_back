  "content": "A dull Ladbrokes Premiership match was drifting nowhere until midfielder Ross Callachan broke the deadlock in the 66th minute before substitute David Milinkovic, on for Lewis Moore, added a second seven minutes later.Another Gorgie replacement, Dario Zanatta, on for Don Cowie, fired in a third with two minutes remaining to leave Craig Levein's side unbeaten in 11 matches with the Tynecastle side also extending their club clean sheet record to eight games.Harry Souttar endured a nightmare Ross County debut as his headed own goal sent Motherwell on their way to a 2-0 victory at Fir Park.The 19-year-old powered Andy Rose's dangerous cross into the top corner under little pressure hours after signing on loan from Stoke. Curtis Main then scored the second for Motherwell.Hibernian bounced back from Sunday's derby disappointment with a 1-0 win over Dundee at Dens Park.Having been knocked out of the Scottish Cup by rivals Hearts, Hibs got their season back on track thanks to John McGinn's second-half strike."
