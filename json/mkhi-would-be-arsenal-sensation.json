  "content": "Mkhitaryan looks set to join the Gunners in January as part of a swap deal involving Alexis Sanchez.The former Borussia Dortmund player joined Manchester United in 2016 but has struggled to hold down a regular starting spot under Jose Mourinho this season.Speaking on The Debate on Sky Sports Premier League, Merson said: \"I am a big fan of Mkhitaryan.\"I watched him at Dortmund, where he was voted player of the season and scored plenty of goals. He has lost his way at Manchester United but if Arsenal get him, with the way they play and the way Arsene Wenger is going forward with attacking players, I think he will be a sensation.\"He is a great signing for Arsenal if they get him.\"Sanchez is top drawer, but to get that kind of quality in January is very rare. Mkhitaryan is one of the best in the Premier League. Any offensive player going to Arsenal under Arsene Wenger is a good move.\"As well as Mkhitaryan, Arsenal also look as though they could sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Dortmund.However, Merson says he would prefer them to sign West Brom defender Jonny Evans over both Mkhitaryan and Aubameyang.\"They need someone at the back. If you keep on leaking goals and defending like they are then you are not going to get in the top four.\"I'm a big fan of Evans. People might say he's at West Brom, but he's one of the best centre-halves around in my opinion.\"He is very underrated, he would be up the top of my list. Get Sanchez done if you can get Mkhi in, and then I would go and get Evans.\"I still think they need a holding player and they are poor at the back. Until they sort that out you can have 10 forwards but it still won't be good enough.\"",
