Nothing is really concrete.\"\nWhen it was suggested those answers implied there was some truth in the speculation, the Gunners boss added: \"You [the media] conclude that.\n\"It's not that I don't want to inform you. I don't want to give you wrong information. At the moment, nothing is decided one way or another.\n\"A bidding war is always beneficial to the club who can take advantage of it but we are not in that.\n\"I maintain what I said. many times, that normally he should stay here until the end of the season, but we will see.\"\nIf Sanchez is sold, Arsenal will be in the market for a new forward themselves.\nAsked if it was possible to replace Sanchez, Wenger said: \"Replaceable in the way, do we find exactly the same player? Certainly not.\n\"But there is always a way, to find a different balance.\n\"Sanchez is an exceptional football player, a world-class player and, if that happens [he is sold], we have to find a different balance in the team.\"\nWhen it was put to him that Sanchez would only be sold if a suitable replacement had been found, Wenger said: \"You sum it up very well.\"\nBordeaux forward Malcom has been mentioned as a possible Sanchez replacement for Arsenal but Wenger responded: \"He's a good player, but at the moment nothing is happening.\n\"We are not on that case at the moment.\"\n",
